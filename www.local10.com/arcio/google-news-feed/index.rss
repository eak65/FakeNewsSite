Missouri voters also will decide on a constitutional amendment on Aug. 4.</p><p>State Question 802 would extend Medicaid health insurance to those earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level, which is about $17,200 for an individual or $35,500 for a family of four.</p><p>Oklahoma is one of 14 states, along with neighboring Texas and Kansas, that have not expanded Medicaid under the 2010 federal Affordable Care Act. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt and his predecessor, Mary Fallin, have opposed expansion, citing uncertainty about future costs for the state.</p><p>“We have a billion-dollar shortfall next year," Stitt said recently at a forum hosted by Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political advocacy group that opposes the measure. The state would have to “either raise taxes or to cut services somewhere else like education, first responders, or roads and bridges” to cut additional Medicaid costs, he said.</p><p>After years of legislative inaction on health insurance proposals, supporters of Medicaid expansion <a href="https://apnews.com/abb64dda7de84544b66d679852aff8a9">launched an initiative petition</a> last year to get the measure on the ballot, and collected a <a href="https://apnews.com/0c5081af1cc44a2bb6282fdb714bf350">record number</a> of signatures. The plan was endorsed by several politically powerful groups, including chambers of commerce, medical trade groups, the Oklahoma Education Association and the Oklahoma Conference of Churches.</p><p>Some Republican opposition to Medicaid expansion has eroded in recent years, particularly in rural areas where hospitals have suffered financial problems or closed. </p><p>Kevin Penry, a Republican and retired pastor from Edmond, said that before going on Medicare last month he had to buy expensive insurance on the federal marketplace, which “really made me feel for folks who are in a difficult financial situation." He said he voted for the expansion.</p><p>The Oklahoma Health Care Authority has projected that about 215,000 residents would qualify for a Medicaid expansion, for a total annual cost of about $1.3 billion. The estimated state share would be about $164 million. But those numbers could be considerably higher given the number of Oklahomans who have lost their jobs and work-related health insurance because of the economic shutdown amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>If the proposal passes, the Legislature is expected to increase a fee that hospitals pay from 2.5% to 4%, which would generate about $134 million annually. Stitt vetoed such a measure earlier this year.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Teams not able to disclose who goes on IL due to virus</title><link>https://www.local10.com/sports/2020/06/30/teams-not-able-to-disclose-who-goes-on-il-due-to-virus/</link><description>New York Yankees general manager Brian Cashman says teams have not been given clearance to announce which players wind up on the injured list due to COVID-19.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/sports/2020/06/30/teams-not-able-to-disclose-who-goes-on-il-due-to-virus/</guid><dc:creator>Joe Reedy, Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 01:38:05 +0000</pubDate><media:content height="3648" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/gfh-raFuXKOfM18JeIUwZr4tvUg=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/3IFGLFCDUFHC5ENPSJZKYONHWQ.jpg" width="5472"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[FILE - In this Sept. 11, 2019, file photo, Colorado Rockies right fielder Charlie Blackmon waits to enter the batting cage before the team's baseball game against the St. Louis Cardinals in Denver.

Testing of players and staff will begin Wednesday as they report to their teams to resume workouts. They will be tested once every two days.</p><p>Last week, <a href="https://apnews.com/dd0357da156125c19953a4afab6a1e2c">Charlie Blackmon of the Colorado Rockies</a> became the first MLB player known to have tested positive. According to reports, the All-Star outfielder was one of three Colorado players to have a positive test.</p><p>Numerous other teams have said they have players who have tested positive for the virus without identifying any of them. The Philadelphia Phillies announced seven, while the Detroit Tigers said one player who was living in Florida but not working out at the team’s spring training facilities in Lakeland also tested positive.</p><p>Seattle Mariners general manager Jerry Dipoto said a few players have tested positive but declined to specify how many. Several Toronto Blue Jays players and staff members also have tested positive.</p><p>Mets general manager Brodie Van Wagenen said remaining educated about best practices is going to be crucial for everyone.</p><p>“Leadership really is going to be the difference-maker for the teams that are able to best handle this and best cope with the challenges that we face,” he said. "And that really is the accountability that needs to be shared by all of us — not just baseball, but our whole society.”</p><p>Baltimore general manager Mike Elias said the Orioles have had no reported cases and that no one on the team has decided against playing in the shortened season.</p><p>He’s hoping for a smooth start to the camp that’s scheduled to begin Friday at Camden Yards.</p><p>“We recognize that this will be fluid and everyone is having to make personal decisions and circumstances might not be fully understood until the season starts, but so far we are expecting full participation,” Elias said. “You see in the news around the league that’s not the case everywhere and I wouldn’t be shocked if that ends up happening, but that’s going to be part of this.”</p><p>“We’re not pressuring anyone or shaming anyone that feels they shouldn’t be here. We’re making that known, and I think it’s well-received,” Elias added. “Our players have been itching to play for a while. I think the whole delay was frustrating for them, for us, and everyone just wants to go play.”</p><p>Marlins CEO Derek Jeter is hoping the return of baseball can provide some solace, much like the Yankees did when they returned after 9-11.</p><p>“We were thinking as players, ‘Do we even play? What does it mean? We’re playing a game.’ Talking to family members who had lost family members and them thanking us — ‘What are you thanking us for?’ They said, ‘We’re thanking you because you’re giving us something to cheer for. There haven’t been too many happy days around here,’" Jeter said. "Baseball played a big role, at least in New York, in the healing process. It’s not saying you’re ever going to forget what happened. But at least for three hours a day we have the opportunity to give them something to cheer for. We hope that’s the case here when we get going in a couple of weeks.”</p><p>___</p><p>AP Baseball Writers Ronald Blum, Mike Fitzpatrick and Ben Walker, and AP Sports Writers David Ginsburg and Steven Wine contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Arizona faces new closures as hospitals prep for virus surge</title><link>https://www.local10.com/health/2020/06/30/arizona-faces-new-closures-as-hospitals-prep-for-virus-surge/</link><description>Arizona hospitals are hiring out-of-state nurses, squeezing in more beds and preparing for the possibility of making life-and-death decisions about how to ration care as they get ready for an expected surge of coronavirus patients.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/health/2020/06/30/arizona-faces-new-closures-as-hospitals-prep-for-virus-surge/</guid><dc:creator>Jonathan J.

<a href="https://apnews.com/7aa2fcf7955333834e01a7f9217c77d2">Arizona and several other states</a> that were reopening their economies have clamped back down over the past week as they eclipsed records for infections and hospitalizations. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, however, went further than others by ordering gyms and movie theaters to close and postponing the start of school until mid-August.</p><p>Texas shut down bars and reduced restaurant capacity, while Florida, where some beaches have been closed, banned alcohol consumption at bars. In contrast, Ducey shut down all bars for 30 days, including in Scottsdale, where employees and young customers crammed into nightclubs without wearing masks or practicing social distancing. </p><p>Like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Ducey ordered tubing businesses to close after images over the weekend showed large numbers of tubers on the Salt River without masks. While Texas limited the number of people at water parks, Arizona closed them altogether for 30 days.</p><p>Tom Hatten, founder and chief executive of Mountainside Fitness, a chain of about 20 gyms across metro Phoenix, said Tuesday that he has no plans to shut down. He has filed court paperwork seeking an injunction against Ducey's closure order, calling it arbitrary and irrational.</p><p>Hatten also said several of his health club’s facilities were cited by police Tuesday for being open.</p><p>Under Ducey's order, the citations carry a fine up to $2,500 if convicted.</p><p>Hatten said it doesn’t make sense that casinos, restaurants and big-box stores can stay open, while gyms are forced to close. </p><p>“We are just as concerned about this virus as everyone. But singling out and closing health clubs, after we sat closed for two months, is not going to keep the virus from spreading,” Hatten said. </p><p>Ducey’s executive order allows local police to enforce closures and government agencies to revoke business licenses. </p><p>In another sign of upheaval, cities are canceling Fourth of July fireworks shows, among them Peoria, Chandler and Marana. Others had already made plans to cancel.</p><p>Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to visit Phoenix on Wednesday and meet with Ducey at the airport before speaking to reporters. It wasn't clear if he had other plans before returning to Washington. Pence’s last-minute trip replaces a planned campaign event in Tucson and meeting with Ducey in Yuma.</p><p>An additional 44 people have died from COVID-19, bringing the total since the beginning of the outbreak to 1,632, health officials said. They reported nearly 4,700 new coronavirus cases Tuesday, an inflated number because of an undercount Monday.</p><p>Arizona has seen skyrocketing infections this month after Ducey allowed his stay-at-home order to expire on May 15. Over the past seven days, nearly one in four coronavirus tests has been positive, a rate far higher than any other state. The positivity rate is a measure of how widespread the disease is in the community. </p><p>Preparing for an influx of patients, hospitals are activating plans to add more beds and staff. State officials have authorized “crisis standards of care,” which tell hospitals which patients should get a ventilator or other scarce resources if there is a shortage. </p><p>If there are more patients than can be cared for at ideal levels, patients are given a score based on their life expectancy and the likelihood their organs will fail. Hospitals are told not to consider factors like race, gender, sexual orientation or disabilities. </p><p>Emergency rooms are not yet overwhelmed, but COVID-19 is taking its toll, said Dr. Frank DelVecchio, who works in emergency rooms at several Phoenix-area hospitals, including Valleywise Health. Nurses caring for coronavirus patients take a significant amount of time suiting up to protect themselves and can't quickly jump from room to room, he said. </p><p>“This is just off the charts, sick patients. We’re letting people go home that we'd never let go home if they were this sick,” including patients with low oxygen, DelVecchio said. “We're trying to get you home oxygen. We’re trying to tell you to come back if worse. Because there's not much we can do for you." </p><p>People who have attempted or considered suicide are getting stuck for a day or more in emergency rooms because psychiatric facilities won't accept them until they have COVID-19 test results. Because suicidal patients require constant monitoring, they are sometimes placed in hallways or less private areas while awaiting results, DelVecchio said. </p><p>Dignity Health, which operates several hospitals in the Phoenix area, is converting more areas to treat COVID-19 patients and preparing to put multiple patients in private rooms, spokeswoman Carmelle Malkovich said. It’s bringing nurses from underutilized hospitals in its system to Arizona and hiring traveling nurses and respiratory therapists throughout July. </p><p>HonorHealth, another big hospital chain in the Phoenix area, is prepared to implement the first phase of its surge plan as soon as this week, officials said in a statement. They did not explain what that means. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rockies GM supports Desmond's decision to skip '20 season </title><link>https://www.local10.com/sports/2020/07/01/rockies-gm-supports-desmonds-decision-to-skip-20-season/</link><description>Colorado Rockies general manager Jeff Bridich says he supports outfielder Ian Desmond's decision to sit out the 2020 major league baseball season over concerns about the coronavirus pandemic and other issues in society.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/sports/2020/07/01/rockies-gm-supports-desmonds-decision-to-skip-20-season/</guid><dc:creator>Arnie Stapleton, Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 01:21:33 +0000</pubDate><media:content height="3151" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/4BK5YlbeAdRNzRVQmgxlmYP-pdk=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/5IJPU46LQZCANJJ3UWNUU2GARM.jpg" width="4515"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[FILE - In this July 29, 2019, file photo, Colorado Rockies' Ian Desmond follows the flight of his triple off Los Angeles Dodgers starting pitcher Kenta Maeda in the second inning of a baseball game in Denver.

He is owed $8 million next year, and his deal includes a $15 million team option for 2022 with a $2 million buyout.</p><p>Opting out this summer doesn’t affect his 2021 status, nor does it affect his relationship with Bridich.</p><p>“Ian is extremely thoughtful in what he does, he’s thoughtful in how he prepares as a professional athlete, he’s thoughtful as a husband and a father ... he’s thoughtful about things that are bigger than him,” Bridich said. “And to this point, the reference has been the team or the clubhouse or the locker room, or things that affect the organization, his charity work, passion projects of his outside of the game of baseball.</p><p>“He’s willing to devote a lot of time and energy and thought to all of the things that he does. And so when you have somebody like that who is a professional athlete who is in the thick of it every day and trying to do the very best that he can to hold up his end of the bargain as an athlete, a teammate, a performer and then he’s always willing to think about other people on the team, in the organization and outside the organization, it’s easy to gravitate to people like that.”</p><p>Desmond complained about a lack of diversity in baseball and criticized the clubhouse atmosphere, saying it includes racism, sexism and homophobia. Bridich said Desmond didn’t complain specifically about the Rockies’ clubhouse, but Bridich did acknowledge the organization could be more diverse.</p><p>In his Instagram post, Desmond said he has been sharing more of his thoughts and experiences as a biracial man since Floyd’s death on May 25. Floyd, a Black man in handcuffs, died after a white police officer held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly eight minutes.</p><p>Desmond said his mind started racing during a recent visit to the Sarasota baseball fields that he played on as a kid. He wrote how they looked run down and neglected, and how important youth baseball was for him growing up.</p><p>Desmond said he wants to help Sarasota Youth Baseball get back on track.</p><p>Although Desmond’s decision is a big loss for Colorado, the Rockies on Tuesday agreed to a minor league deal with veteran Matt Kemp, who owns a .327 batting average with 21 home runs and 77 RBIs over 86 career games at Denver’s downtown ballpark. </p><p>“Yeah, we’re well aware of the damage that he’s done against us,” Bridich said. </p><p>Kemp, who is expected in Denver by Thursday, will have to earn his way onto the roster, and he’ll benefit from the National League using the designated hitter when pro baseball attempts to start the coronavirus-delayed season in late July.</p><p>“The DH is an obvious benefit in terms of his potential place on our major league roster,” Bridich said. “That was going to be the case whether Ian opted in or opted out, and so again, it’s a right-handed power bat. He’s got a sense of the strike zone, we’ve seen it for how many years? And he’s very motivated to get back on the field and continue his career and play well. Whether that’s in the outfield or only at DH, we have to let some weeks pass before we can make any decisions like that.”</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton</p><p>___</p><p>More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US Rep Horn easily captures Democratic nod in 5th District</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/politics/2020/06/30/oklahoma-city-voters-to-pare-down-crowded-5th-district-field/</link><description>Voters in Oklahoma will pare down a crowded field of congressional hopefuls seeking to represent the state's 5th District in Washington.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/news/politics/2020/06/30/oklahoma-city-voters-to-pare-down-crowded-5th-district-field/</guid><dc:creator>Associated Press, Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 01:20:11 +0000</pubDate><media:group><media:content height="2886" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/bryJaTVxu8PudcLhL8kL3GiiK2o=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/MB3BBURLYNG4RDFFFM2FN5XAZQ.jpg" width="4362"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[File-This May 10, 2018, file photo shows Kendra Horn speaking during a forum for Oklahoma 5th congressional district seat Democratic candidates for the group Edmond Democratic Women in Edmond, Okla.

Kendra Horn easily dispatched her lone opponent Tuesday to capture the Democratic nomination in Oklahoma's 5th Congressional District, while Republicans were paring down a crowded field of congressional hopefuls looking to replace her.</p><p>In the race for Oklahoma’s U.S. Senate seat, incumbent U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe defeated three GOP challengers and will face Democrat Abby Broyles, an attorney and former television reporter from Oklahoma City who also bested three primary challengers. </p><p>The real challenge for Horn, the only Democrat in Oklahoma's congressional delegation, comes in November. Nine Republicans are vying to replace her. The 44-year-old attorney pulled one of the nation’s biggest congressional upsets in 2018 when she won a seat that had been in Republican hands for four decades. Tuesday she defeated perennial candidate Tom Guild, a retired college professor from Edmond</p><p>Horn is considered one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents in the nation because she represents a district President Donald Trump won by nearly 14 points in 2016.</p><p>“I like her and think she's doing a great job," said Darla Ryan, 59, a Democrat who cast her ballot for Horn Tuesday at Life Church in Edmond, Oklahoma. “I voted for her last time, too."</p><p>Four of the GOP challengers have raised more than $500,000, including businesswoman Terry Neese, state Sen. Stephanie Bice, former state education superintendent Janet Barresi and businessman David Hill. The crowded field makes a primary runoff likely.</p><p>Horn has raised more than $3.3 million this cycle, the most of anyone in the state’s delegation.</p><p>While a record number of Oklahomans cast absentee ballots by mail this year, turnout was steady Tuesday at several polling places in the Oklahoma City metro area. At Life Church, most voters were wearing masks and maintaining social distancing in a line that stretched into the parking lot.</p><p>Savannah Steele, 19, a college student from Edmond who was voting for the first time, said the coronavirus pandemic made her uneasy.</p><p>“In Oklahoma, with (the number of reported cases) spiking, that was a concern, but with people staying six feet apart and wearing masks, it was fine," Steele said.</p><p>Two other Republican incumbents, U.S. Reps. Markwayne Mullin and Tom Cole, also won their primaries Tuesday. Republican U.S. Reps. Kevin Hern and Frank Lucas do not have primary opponents. </p><p>Also on the ballot Tuesday is a proposal to amend the Oklahoma Constitution to extend Medicaid health coverage to tens of thousands of low-income residents. Oklahoma is one of 14 states that have not expanded Medicaid — along with neighboring states Texas and Kansas—as part of the 2010 federal Affordable Care Act.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Florida man arrested after allegedly going on gun-toting rant, yelling racial slur at random Miami-Dade resident</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/06/30/florida-man-arrested-after-allegedly-going-on-gun-toting-rant-yelling-racial-slur-at-random-miami-dade-resident/</link><description>A South Florida man is in trouble with the law after going on racist rant and pulling out a gun.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/06/30/florida-man-arrested-after-allegedly-going-on-gun-toting-rant-yelling-racial-slur-at-random-miami-dade-resident/</guid><dc:creator>Roy Ramos</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 01:15:01 +0000</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A South Florida man is in trouble with the law after yelling a racial slur and going on a rant while holding a gun.</p><p>It all happened in the West Little River neighborhood of Northwest Miami Dade County back on June 14th. </p><p>According to the resident, Dewayne Wynn, he was talking to his neighbor when he saw an SUV pull up to his home and drop a flyer into his mailbox. </p><p>But when Wynn walked across the street to get the flier, he said he was confronted by a man who pulled a gun out on him and then began shouting racial slurs. </p><p>Part of that rant was captured on cell phone video taken by Wynn.</p><p>The man seen in that video is 58-year-old Joseph Fucheck, who Local 10 News discovered is a real-estate agent in North Miami Beach. </p><p>In that cell phone video, Fucheck can be heard telling Wynn it is not his home and he does not live there.

But those were largely gone later Tuesday. </p><p>People have occupied several blocks around a park and the Seattle Police Department’s East Precinct for about two weeks after police abandoned the building following standoffs and clashes with protesters calling for racial justice and an end to police brutality.</p><p>Seattle police Assistant Chief Adrian Diaz said the large, makeshift barriers would be removed in incremental steps to allow traffic to move through portions of a road that had been closed off.</p><p>“So far, you know, everything is peaceful this morning, so that’s a good sign,” Diaz <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattle-removes-some-barriers-at-chop/">told</a> The Seattle Times.</p><p>Cement barricades that remained in front of the Seattle Police Department East Precinct building Tuesday were fortified by protesters with chunks of concrete and tarps. </p><p>There have been increasing calls by critics, including President Donald Trump, to remove protesters from the “Capitol Hill Occupied Protest” area east of downtown following the fatal shooting Monday of a 16-year-old boy and the June 20 killing of a 19-year-old man. </p><p>Protesters say they should not be blamed for the violence in the area. People continued to add artwork, flowers and candles at a memorial for the 16-year-old on Tuesday. </p><p>Police Chief Carmen Best has said the shootings are obscuring the message of racial justice promoted by protesters.</p><p>Nearby businesses and property owners filed a federal lawsuit against the city last week, saying officials have been too tolerant of those who created the zone and that officials have deprived property owners of their property rights by allowing the zone to continue existing.</p><p>Also Tuesday, Mayor Jenny Durkan asked the City Council to investigate council member Kshama Sawant, accusing her of opening City Hall to protesters on June 9 and participating in a protest march to Durkan’s home on Sunday. </p><p>“She and organizers knew that my address was protected under the state confidentiality program because of threats against me due largely to my work as U.S. attorney,” Durkan wrote.</p><p>Sawant said she had not organized the march and wasn't taking Durkan's words personally, The Seattle Times <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/durkan-asks-seattle-city-council-to-investigate-sawant-for-contemptuous-behavior/">reported</a>. </p><p>“In reality, this is an attack on working people’s movements, and everything we are fighting for, by a corporate politician desperately looking to distract from her failures of leadership and politically bankrupt administration,” Sawant said in a statement.</p><p>Earlier this month Sawant and other council members called on the mayor to resign over what they called the Police Department’s militaristic response to protests. Durkan has said she will not resign.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press photographer Ted Warren contributed to this report. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Carl Reiner, beloved creator of ‘Dick Van Dyke Show,’ dies</title><link>https://www.local10.com/entertainment/2020/06/30/carl-reiner-beloved-creator-of-dick-van-dyke-show-dies/</link><description>Carl Reiner, the ingenious and versatile comedy writer, actor and director, has died, according to reports.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/entertainment/2020/06/30/carl-reiner-beloved-creator-of-dick-van-dyke-show-dies/</guid><dc:creator>Mike Stewart, Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 01:11:09 +0000</pubDate><media:group><media:content height="1709" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/-sEEfvMbc8m7R-vOKscJpnNlcb4=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/PIPZYLF25FB35OI7VOH4KM6RRY.jpg" width="2346"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[FILE - In this May 26, 1963 file photo, Carl Reiner shows holds two Emmy statuettes presented to him as best comedy writer for the "Dick Van Dyke Show," during the annual Emmy Awards presentation in Los Angeles.

He was 98.</p><p>Reiner’s assistant Judy Nagy said he died Monday night of natural causes at his home in Beverly Hills, California. </p><p>Reiner was the father of actor-director Rob Reiner, who tweeted that his “heart is hurting. He was my guiding light.” The younger Reiner starred as Archie Bunker’s son-in-law on “All in the Family” and directed “When Harry Met Sally...”</p><p>Carl Reiner was one of show business’ best-liked men. Bald or toupeed, his was a welcome face on the small and silver screens: In Caesar’s 1950s troupe; as the self-absorbed Alan Brady of “The Dick Van Dyke Show”; and in such films as “The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming” and “It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.” </p><p>In recent years, he was part of the roguish gang in the “Ocean’s Eleven” movies starring George Clooney and appeared in documentaries including “Broadway: Beyond the Golden Age” and “If You’re Not in the Obit, Eat Breakfast.” </p><p>Tributes poured in, with Van Dyke calling Reiner “kind, gentle, compassionate, empathetic and wise,” and Clooney saying he made “every room he walked into funnier, smarter, kinder.”</p><p>Betty White described herself as privileged to work with Reiner and “heartbroken.” Steve Martin said goodbye to “my greatest mentor in movies and in life. Thank you, dear Carl.” Billy Crystal said “all of us in comedy have lost a giant,” and Sarah Silverman said ”his humanity was beyond compare.”</p><p>Brooks said he and Reiner had been best friends since meeting on “Your Show of Shows." </p><p>“Carl was a giant, unmatched in his contributions to entertainment," Brooks said. “When we were doing ”The 2000 Year Old Man" together there was no better straight man in the world. So whether he wrote or performed or he was just your best friend — nobody could do it better. He’ll be greatly missed. A tired cliché in times like this, but in Carl Reiner’s case it’s absolutely true. He will be greatly missed.”</p><p>Reiner directed such films as “Oh, God!” starring George Burns and John Denver; “All of Me,” with Martin and Lily Tomlin; and the 1970 comedy “Where’s Poppa?” His books include “Enter Laughing,” an autobiographical novel later adapted into a film and Broadway show; and “My Anecdotal Life,” a memoir published in 2003. He recounted his childhood and creative journey in the 2013 book, “I Remember Me.”</p><p>But many remember Reiner for “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” one of the most popular TV series of all time and a model of ensemble playing, physical comedy and timeless, good-natured wit. It starred Van Dyke as a television comedy writer working for a demanding, eccentric boss (Reiner) and living with his wife (Mary Tyler Moore in her first major TV role) and son.</p><p>“The Van Dyke show is probably the most thrilling of my accomplishments because that was very, very personal,” Reiner once said. “It was about me and my wife, living in New Rochelle and working on the Sid Caesar show." </p><p>The pilot, written by Reiner, starred himself as Rob Petrie, and aired in July 1960. When the show was reworked (CBS executives worried Reiner would make the lead character seem too Jewish), Van Dyke was cast and the program ran from 1961 to 1966. One famous fan, Orson Welles, was known for rushing to his bedroom in the afternoon so he could be near a TV when the show was on.</p><p>“Although it was a collaborative effort,″ Van Dyke later wrote, ”everything about the show stemmed from his (Reiner’s) endlessly and enviably fascinating, funny, and fertile brain and trickled down to the rest of us." </p><p>The story line had Petrie as the head writer for “The Alan Brady Show,” a comedy-variety series not unlike “Your Show of Shows,” in which Reiner, as Brady, was the egocentric star. Petrie’s fellow writers were character actors Morey Amsterdam as Buddy Sorrell and Rose Marie as Sally Rogers.</p><p>It was an early parody of the Caesar show, which would later be dramatized in the film “My Favorite Year” and Neil Simon’s play “Laughter on the 23rd Floor.”</p><p>Besides acting in and producing the “Van Dyke” series, Reiner wrote or co-wrote dozens of episodes. Although the show was the best of good clean fun, it wasn’t clean enough for network censors. Reiner often battled network officials over the sleeping arrangements of Rob and his wife; the Petries slept in twin beds. He wanted them to sleep in a double bed.</p><p>Reiner joined the classic comedy revue “Your Show of Shows” in 1950 after performing in Broadway plays. Much of Reiner’s early work came as a “second banana” — although, as Caesar once put it, “Such bananas don’t grow on trees.” He performed in sketches — satirizing everything from foreign films to rock ‘n’ roll — and added his talents to a writing team that included Brooks, Simon, Woody Allen and Larry Gelbart.</p><p>“As second banana,” he told TV Guide, “I had a chance to do just about everything a performer can ever get to do. If it came off well, I got all the applause. If it didn’t, the show was blamed.”</p><p>It was during the “Show of Shows” years that Reiner and Brooks started improvising skits which became the basis for “The 2000 Year Old Man.” Reiner was the interviewer, Brooks the old man and witness to history.</p><p>Reiner: “Did you know Jesus?”</p><p>Brooks: “I knew Christ, Christ was a thin lad, always wore sandals. Hung around with 12 other guys. They came in the store, no one ever bought anything. Once they asked for water.”</p><p>After the pair performed the routine at a party, Reiner said Steve Allen insisted they turn their banter into a record. The album, “2000 Years with Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks,” appeared in 1960 and was the start of a million-selling franchise. </p><p>The duo won a Grammy in 1998 for their “The 2000 Year Old Man in the Year 2000” and Reiner won multiple Emmys for his television work. In 2000, he received the Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for Humor. When the sound system failed at the start of the ceremonies, Reiner called from the balcony, “Does anybody have four double-A batteries?”</p><p>Besides “All of Me,” Reiner directed Martin in “Dead Men Don’t Wear Plaid,” “The Man With Two Brains” and “The Jerk.”</p><p>Carl Reiner was born in 1922, in New York City’s Bronx borough, one of two sons of Jewish immigrants. He grew up in a working-class neighborhood, where he learned to mimic voices and tell jokes. After high school, Reiner attended drama school, then joined a small theater group.</p><p>During World War II, Reiner joined the Army and toured in GI variety shows for a year and a half. Back out of uniform, he landed several stage roles, breaking through on Broadway in “Call Me Mister.”</p><p>He married his wife, Estelle, in 1943. Besides son Rob, the couple had another son, Lucas, a film director, and a daughter, Sylvia, a psychoanalyst and author. Estelle Reiner, who died in 2008, had a small role in Rob Reiner’s “When Harry Met Sally...” — as the woman who overhears Meg Ryan's ersatz ecstasy in a restaurant and says, “I’ll have what she’s having.”</p><p>Carl Reiner's greatest disappointment was “Bert Rigby, You’re a Fool,” a 1989 musical he wrote and directed that starred Robert Lindsay, a British actor Reiner believed could be a new Dick Van Dyke. The film flopped, and Reiner’s career as a director faded.</p><p>Reiner, inducted into the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences’ Hall of Fame, remained involved in other entertainment projects. In the 1990s, he reprised the Alan Brady character for an episode of “Mad About You.”</p><p>His death was first reported Tuesday by celebrity website TMZ.</p><p>____</p><p>AP National Writer Hillel Italie and Entertainment Writer Mark Kennedy contributed to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Officers put on leave over photos tied to Elijah McClain</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/national/2020/06/30/officers-put-on-leave-over-photos-tied-to-elijah-mcclain/</link><description>Suburban Denver police say multiple officers are on paid leave during an investigation into photos that emerged of them near where Elijah McClain died last summer.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/news/national/2020/06/30/officers-put-on-leave-over-photos-tied-to-elijah-mcclain/</guid><dc:creator>Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 01:01:39 +0000</pubDate><media:group><media:content height="2686" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/h7w1CfTYUlH8ft_XFCAv5OP3T4g=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/VELE6HOGGVBEJEFI657CWFCDJY.jpg" width="4507"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[FILE - In this June 27, 2020, file photo, demonstrators carry a giant placard during a rally and march over the death of 23-year-old Elijah McClain outside the police department in Aurora, Colo.

The Justice Department usually does not comment on investigations until they are complete, but the announcement noted that “there are specific cases in which doing so is warranted if such information is in the best interest of the public and public safety."</p><p>The interim police chief of the city of Aurora, Vanessa Wilson, announced the internal police investigation into the photos Monday night. In a statement, she said the suspended officers were “depicted in photographs near the site where Elijah McClain died.” She did not provide more details about what the images show or how many officers were on leave. </p><p>The two photos were taken near where police stopped the 23-year-old on Aug. 24, 2019, as they responded to a report of a suspicious person walking down the street wearing a face mask, said Officer Matthew Longshore, an Aurora police spokesman. The pictures were not taken during the fatal run-in, Longshore said.</p><p>McClain’s death generated new attention after the death of George Floyd stirred worldwide protests over racial injustice and police brutality. Floyd died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into the handcuffed Black man's neck for nearly eight minutes.</p><p>In McClain's case, police body-camera video shows an Aurora officer getting out of his car, approaching McClain and saying, “Stop right there. Stop. Stop. ... I have a right to stop you because you’re being suspicious.”</p><p>In the video, the officer turns McClain around and repeats, “Stop tensing up.” As McClain tries to escape the officer’s grip, the officer says, “Relax, or I’m going to have to change this situation.”</p><p>As other officers join to restrain McClain, he begs them to let go and says, “You guys started to arrest me, and I was stopping my music to listen.”</p><p>Aurora police have said McClain refused to stop walking and fought back when officers tried to take him into custody. The officers used a chokehold that cuts off blood to the brain — a tactic recently banned in several places following Floyd’s death. </p><p>In the video, McClain tells officers: “Let go of me. I am an introvert. Please respect the boundaries that I am speaking.”</p><p>Paramedics administered 500 milligrams of a sedative to calm him down, police have said. He was on the ground for 15 minutes as several officers and paramedics stood by. McClain, a massage therapist and self-taught violinist, suffered cardiac arrest and was later declared brain dead and taken off life support.</p><p>A forensic pathologist could not determine what exactly led to his death but said physical exertion during the confrontation likely contributed. </p><p>An officer reported the photos to the department's internal affairs division Thursday. Wilson said she learned of the investigation that day and ordered investigators to make it their top priority.</p><p>The investigation was completed Monday and the results, including the photos, will be made public after police officials give a review and Wilson makes a decision on how to respond, Longshore said.

I would not be surprised if we go up to to 100,000 a day if this does not turn around, and so I am very concerned,” said Fauci, infectious disease chief at the National Institutes of Health.</p><p>Fauci said areas seeing recent outbreaks are putting the entire nation at risk, including areas that have made progress in reducing COVID-19 cases. He cited recent video footage of people socializing in crowds, often without masks, and otherwise ignoring safety guidelines.</p><p>___</p><p>ROCKVILLE, Md. — Vice President Mike Pence is stressing the country is in a far better position to battle the coronavirus than it was months ago, even as cases continue to rise, especially across the south.</p><p>Pence put a positive spin on the progress at a briefing by the White House’s coronavirus task force at the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps headquarters in Maryland on Tuesday.</p><p>He says: “’We want to assure you that we’re ready — more ready than ever before — to meet this coronavirus pandemic.”</p><p>Task force members outlined improvements in testing capacity, the availability of protective gear, and new therapeutics even as the U.S. is now reporting about 40,000 new cases daily.</p><p>The comments came hours after the nation’s top infectious diseases expert warned during a congressional hearing that “we’re going in the wrong direction” and said the country could soon see as many as 100,000 new cases a day.</p><p>Still, Pence said the administration fully supports the decision of some states to-shutter certain business or delay reopening efforts due to rising cases.</p><p>The members also urged Americans to abide by public health recommendation, including wearing masks in public, saying they are key to keeping the country open.</p><p>___</p><p>UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations Security Council is trying again to reach agreement on its first resolution on COVID-19 since the coronavirus started circling the globe in February after a lengthy dispute between the U.S. and China over mentioning the World Health Organization.</p><p>A revised draft resolution by France and Tunisia was submitted for a vote Tuesday, and the result is expected to be announced on Wednesday.</p><p>The draft resolution backs Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ March 23 call for global cease-fires to tackle the pandemic, and demands an “immediate cessation of hostilities” in all conflicts on the council’s agenda including Syria, Yemen, Libya, South Sudan and Congo.</p><p>It calls on all warring parties “to engage immediately in a durable humanitarian pause for at least 90 consecutive days” to enable the safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid and medical evacuations.</p><p>President Donald Trump suspended funding to the World Health Organization in early April, accusing the U.N. health agency of failing to stop the virus from spreading when it first surfaced in China, and accusing WHO of parroting Beijing.</p><p>China strongly supports the WHO and insisted that its role in calling for global action on COVID-19 be included in any resolution, diplomats said, while the U.S. insisted on a reference to “transparency” on COVID-19 and no mention of the WHO.</p><p>The draft being put to a vote doesn’t mention either the WHO, a U.N. health agency or transparency.</p><p>But it does take note of a resolution adopted April 2 by the 193-member U.N. General Assembly which “calls for intensified international cooperation to contain, mitigate and defeat the pandemic, including ... by applying the relevant guidelines recommended by the World Health Organization.”</p><p>___</p><p>COLUMBIA, Mo. — Missouri reached a grim new milestone in its battle with the coronavirus on Tuesday, surpassing 1,000 deaths amid a resurgence of the disease that has seen cases skyrocket in recent weeks.</p><p>“That’s 1,000 people that lost their lives due to COVID-19,” Gov. Mike Parson said Tuesday. “I think we all need to remember that.”</p><p>The state health department raised the death toll by 17, to 1,015, and added more than 500 confirmed cases to the statewide tally, raising it to 21,551 since the pandemic started.

Still, health department Director Randall Williams urged people to continue hand washing and social distancing or wearing masks, especially on July 4. </p><p>“Going into this weekend, even if you’re outside, we really, really would encourage you to practice social distancing,” Williams said. </p><p>Despite the worsening situation, the University of Missouri is preparing to welcome back students for on-campus classes this fall. The university said Monday that it will require students, faculty and staff to wear masks in classrooms when on-campus classes resume in August, though those plans could change depending on the coronavirus situation.

That is despite Republican Gov. Greg Abbott urging the public to wear masks and stay home.</p><p>The Texas Medical Association told GOP leaders that now is “not the time to bring thousands of the party faithful from around the state” together for an indoor meeting. </p><p>The organization represents more than 50,000 physicians in Texas and is a sponsor of the convention, which begins July 16.</p><p>Texas GOP Chairman James Dickey responded by saying the party is taking all input seriously but was noncommittal about whether it would change any minds.</p><p>___</p><p>DENVER — Gov. Jared Polis says Colorado will rein in previously set rules for bars and nightlife because of the potential for spreading coronavirus. </p><p>After speaking with the governors from Texas and Arizona, which have seen spikes in new cases, Polis says they believe bars and nightclubs have been major sources of outbreaks, especially among young people. </p><p>Previous rules announced June 18 under Colorado’s “Protect Our Neighbors” program allowed for reduced capacity at 25 percent or 50 people. Under the new modifications, which Polis says will go into effect under the next 48 hours, bars will be closed for in-person service. </p><p>But those with dining options may continue to serve customers and sell takeout alcohol.</p><p>___</p><p>HARRISBURG, Pa. — Philadelphia is bringing a halt to its plans to allow indoor dining, bars, gyms and fitness centers to reopen, with officials saying Tuesday that the city is seeing rising case COVID-19 counts and could be affected by a growing epidemic elsewhere in the country.</p><p>The city’s health commissioner, Dr. Tom Farley, broke the bad news during a news conference ahead of its Friday target to lift more restrictions. </p><p>Hospitalizations are not seeing a corresponding increase, but Farley said that is a lagging indicator.</p><p>Across the state, Allegheny County recorded another single-day record high of new cases reported Tuesday.</p><p>The county, which includes Pittsburgh and is Pennsylvania’s second-most populous with 1.2 million residents, over the weekend ordered a halt to drinking alcohol in bars and restaurants amid what officials there called an “alarming” spike in COVID-19 cases.</p><p>___</p><p>WILMINGTON, Del. — Joe Biden says he has not been tested for COVID-19 yet but expects to be “relatively soon.”</p><p>The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, speaking to reporters after a campaign event in Delaware on Tuesday, said he hasn’t yet taken a test because “I have had no symptoms” and “I haven’t wanted to take anyone else’s place in the process.” </p><p>He added, however, “so it doesn’t look like I’m moving to the front of the line,” he expects to be tested “relatively soon.”</p><p>Biden said that the Secret Service stationed around his home and anyone who comes into his home, including staff, are tested. He also noted his daughter, who worked in Florida, was tested twice for the coronavirus.</p><p>___</p><p>OTTAWA — The Canadian government says it has extended rules barring most foreign travelers from entering Canada until the end of July as part of efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19. </p><p>The restrictions covering everyone except Canadian citizens and permanent residents — as well as Americans entering Canada for essential reasons — were set to expire at midnight. </p><p>A spokeswoman for the Canada Border Services Agency says all optional or discretionary travel through all ports of entry is covered. </p><p>But there are exceptions to allow in immediate family of Canadian citizens or permanent residents, as well as to cover cases such as flight crews. </p><p>The closure of the Canada-U.S. border to all but essential workers and trade until at least July 21 is covered by a separate order.</p><p>___</p><p>ROME — Italy is still insisting on coronavirus quarantines for visitors from the 14 countries green-lighted by the European Union to visit.</p><p>Health Minister Roberto Speranza said Italy was taking the “line of caution” given its battle to contain the outbreak in the onetime epicenter of Europe’s COVID-19 emergency.</p><p>The EU said Tuesday it would reopen its borders to travelers from 14 countries — Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay. </p><p>Chinese visitors are likely to be readmitted soon, but not most from the U.S., where infections are surging.</p><p>Speranza signed an ordinance Tuesday requiring “fiduciary quarantine” for visitors from the 14 countries. He said in a statement: “The situation at the global level remains very complex. We must avoid that the sacrifices made by Italians in these months are in vain.”</p><p>Italy registered its first positive case Feb. 21 and for weeks had the world’s highest death toll. But after a 10-week lockdown and strict hygiene and social distancing measures that are still in force, Italy has largely brought its outbreak under control. On Tuesday for example, Italy registered 23 new victims and 142 new confirmed infections.</p><p>___</p><p>RALEIGH, N.C. — North Carolina has announced plans to test all nursing home patients and workers for the coronavirus.</p><p>Mandy Cohen, the state’s top public health official, said Tuesday that the one-time tests will be given between July and mid-August to help curb the virus.</p><p>Cohen said the state is partnering with CVS Omnicare to test an estimated 36,000 nursing home residents and 25,000 workers in more than 400 sites throughout the state.</p><p>The cost of the program was not immediately provided, but Cohen said when possible insurance will be billed. Otherwise, the costs will be covered by the Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p>Recent statewide data recorded by the public health agency shows 4,440 of the state’s 64,670 laboratory-confirmed coronavirus cases occurred in nursing homes. </p><p>But nursing homes account for 660 of the state’s 1,343 coronavirus deaths.</p><p>___</p><p>WASHINGTON — The head of the Food and Drug Administration says vaccine developers will be expected to study COVID-19 shots in racial minorities, the elderly, pregnant women and those with other health conditions.</p><p>FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn outlined the guidelines for potential vaccines at a Senate hearing on reopening schools and workplaces.</p><p>Hahn says “while the FDA is committed to help expedite this work, we will not cut corners in our decision-making.”</p><p>The agency has come under criticism for granting emergency authorization to a malaria drug touted by President Donald Trump as a treatment for coronavirus. The agency revoked that designation earlier this month after studies found the drug was ineffective against the virus.</p><p>The U.S. is set to begin a 30,000-person trial of a government-created shot starting next month. Under the Trump administration’s program dubbed “Operation Warp Speed,” health officials aim to have 300 million doses on hand by January.</p><p>About 15 experimental COVID-19 vaccines are in various stages of testing worldwide.

The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, a group of European, Australian, North American, and Japanese politicians from across the political spectrum, demanded an independent U.N. investigation.</p><p>“The world cannot remain silent in the face of unfolding atrocities,” the group said in a statement. </p><p>The AP found that the Chinese government regularly subjects minority women in Xinjiang to pregnancy checks and forces intrauterine devices, sterilization and even abortion on hundreds of thousands. <a href="https://jamestown.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Zenz-Sterilizations-IUDs-and-Mandatory-Birth-Control-FINAL-27June.pdf?x61565">New research</a> obtained by The Associated Press in advance of publication by China scholar Adrian Zenz also showed that the hundreds of millions of dollars the government pours into birth control has transformed Xinjiang from one of China’s fastest-growing regions to among its slowest in just a few years. </p><p>The AP found that the population control measures are backed by mass detention both as a threat and as a punishment for failure to comply. Having too many children is a major reason people are sent to detention camps, documents and interviews show, with the parents of three or more ripped away from their families unless they can pay huge fines. </p><p>The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom called for a U.N. and State Department investigation, saying the Chinese government’s birth control campaign “might meet the legal criteria for genocide.” According to a U.N. convention, “imposing measures intended to prevent births” with “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group" is considered evidence of genocide. The last colonial governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, told Bloomberg Television that the birth control campaign was “arguably something that comes within the terms of the UN views on sorts of genocide.”</p><p>The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee called the forced birth control “beyond deplorable,” and said that “a nation that treats its own people this way should never be considered a great power.” U.S. senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris wrote a letter urging the Trump administration to respond to an “alarming” AP investigation, and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Ro Khanna also called for action. </p><p>U.S. President Donald Trump told China President Xi Jinping <a href="https://apnews.com/63f156933a5520d157dea25ab764af09">he was right to build detention camps</a> to house hundreds of thousands of ethnic minorities, according to a new book by former national security adviser John Bolton. However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the reports of forced birth control for minorities were “shocking” and “disturbing” in a statement Monday.</p><p>“We call on the Chinese Communist Party to immediately end these horrific practices,” he said.</p><p>Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian fired back on Tuesday by calling Pompeo “a brazen liar,” saying the Uighur population had more than doubled since 1978 in response to criticism of Xinjiang’s birth control policies.</p><p>“If Mr. Pompeo is telling the truth, how can he explain the big increase in the Uighur population?” Zhao asked.</p><p>For decades, Xinjiang’s population grew quickly, as minorities enjoyed laxer birth control restrictions than Han Chinese. But in just three years, new measures have caused the birth rate in Xinjiang’s Uighur-majority areas to plunge, and it is now well under the national average. </p><p>Zhao also said the American government had been responsible for “genocide, racial segregation and assimilation policies" on Native Americans. on them.” University of Colorado researcher Darren Byler said the Chinese state-orchestrated assault on Xinjiang's minorities does echo past birth control programs.</p><p>“It recalls the American eugenics movement which targeted Native and African Americans up until the 1970s,” he said. “China’s public health authorities are conducting a mass experiment in targeted genetic engineering on Turkic Muslim populations.”</p><p>In response to the AP story, which he called “fake news,” Zhao said the government treats all ethnicities equally and protects their legal rights. Chinese officials have said in the past that the new measures are merely meant to be fair, with the law now allowing minorities and China’s Han majority the same number of children. </p><p>However, the AP’s reporting found that while equal on paper, in practice Han Chinese are largely spared the abortions, sterilizations, IUD insertions and detentions for having too many children that are forced on Xinjiang’s other ethnicities, interviews and data show. Some rural minorities are punished even for having the three children allowed by the law.</p><p>British members of Parliament debated Xinjiang in the House of Commons on Monday, with both Labor and Conservative politicians urging the U.K. Foreign Ministry to adopt a stronger stance against the Chinese government. Nigel Adams, the British Minister of State for Asia, said the reports added to the U.K.’s “concern about the human rights situation in Xinjiang” and that it will be "considering this report very carefully.” Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne also told Australian broadcaster SBS that the reports “further compounded” their concerns.</p><p>Bill Browder, CEO of investment fund Hermitage Capital Management and brainchild of the Magnitsky Act, asked the U.S. government to level sanctions against Chinese officials, calling the birth control campaign part of a broader assault he called “vile persecution.” </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>PM Modi says virus status 'critical,' warns of carelessness</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/world/2020/06/30/pm-modi-says-virus-status-critical-warns-of-carelessness/</link><description>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi says the country’s coronavirus death rate is under control, but that the country is at a “critical juncture."</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/news/world/2020/06/30/pm-modi-says-virus-status-critical-warns-of-carelessness/</guid><dc:creator>Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 00:37:50 +0000</pubDate><media:group><media:content height="3936" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/tAf8kdNUSJw_hKg1nKNChGaLKiI=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/2CO2RBVS5VGTLH6XEOFTLXQZUQ.jpg" width="6003"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Naga women wear masks as a precaution against the coronavirus and walk past closed shops early morning in Kohima, capital of the northeastern Indian state of Nagaland, Tuesday, June 30, 2020.

Each points at the other’s party.</p><p>“I really, really, really believe we’re on the cusp of what could be the most corrupt process that we’ve seen in a general election if we don’t monitor this every single second,” Biden told donors Tuesday evening as he discussed Trump’s and many Republicans’ opposition to expanding early voting and mail-in voting amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>That’s similar language to what Trump has tweeted to his millions of social media followers in recent weeks. “Mail-in voting … will lead to the most corrupt election in USA history,” Trump declared Sunday.</p><p>The president previously argued that mail-balloting allows voters to “cheat.” One such tweet <a href="https://apnews.com/700c52aab0869253625b80255a397f19">drew a rare, special tag</a> from Twitter that directed readers to mail-voting facts that rebutted the president’s unsupported claims about voter fraud. There are instances of voter fraud in the U.S., most often found in local or smaller jurisdictional elections, but there is no evidence of widespread fraud that would tilt statewide or national results.</p><p>Biden noted Tuesday that Trump himself has voted using mail ballots, most recently using Florida’s absentee process to cast his Republican primary ballot in March. </p><p>Similar word choice aside, Biden’s and Trump’s disparate framing of voting by mail tracks the long-running, largely partisan fight over ballot access and election security. Republicans nationally have pushed aggressive culling of voter rolls, identification requirements that are arduous for some voters, and strict signature and witness rules for absentee ballots. GOP officials cast such rules as necessary fraud prevention; Democrats call them systemic voter suppression. </p><p>“We have got to keep ringing the bell about this all the way to the election,” Biden said, adding that his campaign and the Democratic Party have put together a team of hundreds of lawyers and volunteers to focus on voter protection and education. “It’s the greatest concern I have,” Biden said, “not just for my race, but for races up and down the ballot.” </p><p>Biden singled out Trump’s opposition to injecting federal aid into the <a href="https://apnews.com/d52e51e5392d2f4d32a56a2060446847">U.S. Postal Service</a>. “He’s talking about defunding the post office so they can’t deliver mail-in ballots,” Biden said. </p><p>The postal agency doesn’t actually get direct taxpayer support for normal operations, as Biden's dig suggested. But COVID-19 has devastated its already precarious finances, and Congress has considered an aid package. Trump’s White House blocked one bailout effort earlier this year and wants to attach strings to any taxpayer assistance.</p><p>At the time, Biden said that he believed Trump was pushing a narrative to cloud the results in November should the president lose. Biden went so far in that April 23 event as to <a href="https://apnews.com/6cf3ca7d5a174f2f381636cb4706f505">suggest Trump might attempt</a> to postpone the election. Biden offered no evidence of that claim. </p><p>Besides Trump’s opposition to mail ballots, Biden declared Tuesday that dozens of proposals from state lawmakers around the country amount to “Jim Crow-type efforts to restrict access to voting.” He did not elaborate. But he promised to “restore the Voting Rights Act,” the 1965 civil rights law that, until a 2013 Supreme Court ruling, required many Southern states and some counties outside the South to get federal approval for all changes to election rules and procedures.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Carl Reiner, comedy’s rare untortured genius, dies at 98</title><link>https://www.local10.com/entertainment/2020/06/30/carl-reiner-comedys-rare-untortured-genius-dies-at-98/</link><description>Carl Reiner,  who died Monday at 98, was the rare untortured genius of comedy, his career a story of laughter and camaraderie, of innovation and triumph and affection.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/entertainment/2020/06/30/carl-reiner-comedys-rare-untortured-genius-dies-at-98/</guid><dc:creator>Hillel Italie, Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 00:35:05 +0000</pubDate><media:group><media:content height="2957" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/nijwQX9wCK6ka8N5UqA95SXY4ic=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/GV2QDPPFGJG2BBPWUV5ZK3KCE4.jpg" width="2997"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[FILE - In this May 25, 1967 file writer-comedian Carl Reiner poses in his new hairpiece in Los Angeles.

His persona was so warm and approachable — everyone’s friend or favorite uncle — that you could forget that he was an architect of modern comedy, a “North Star,” in the words of Billy Crystal.</p><p>As a writer and director, he mastered a genial, but sophisticated brand of humor that Steve Martin, Jerry Seinfeld and others emulated. As an actor, he was the ideal straight man for such manic performers as Mel Brooks and Sid Caesar and dependably funny on his own. As an all-around talent, he helped perfect two standard television formats — sketch and situation comedy.</p><p>
<a href="https://apnews.com/ad8fd934534a1c5ea5b2ad8caf18716c">Reiner’s death Monday at 98 </a> from natural causes prompted an outpouring from t <a href="https://apnews.com/fddf60cd85313f3dca8112e9f71cf8be">hose he inspired, a group that included Brooks, Dick Van Dyke, George Clooney and Billy Eichner and millions more</a>. </p><p>Tall and agile, equally striking whether bald or toupeed, he entertained in every medium available to him, from movies and vinyl records to Broadway and Twitter. But he will be remembered best for “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” the landmark series which aired from 1961-66 and was a master class of wit, ensemble playing, physical comedy and the overriding good nature of Reiner himself. </p><p>Based on his time in the 1950s with Sid Caesar’s “Your Show of Shows,” the forerunner to “Saturday Night Live,” it was among the first sit-coms about TV itself and inspired such future hits as “Mad About You” and “30 Rock.”</p><p>As millions of fans know, Van Dyke starred as comedy writer Rob Petrie, who worked for the demanding, eccentric Alan Brady (Reiner) and lived on Bonnie Meadow Road in suburban New Rochelle with his wife Laura (Mary Tyler Moore, in her first major TV role) and young son. Petrie’s fellow writers were veteran character actors Morey Amsterdam as Buddy Sorrell and Rose Marie as Sally Rogers. Reiner originally had a very different title and cast in mind. The pilot was called “Head of the Family,” which starred Reiner and Barbara Britton, and aired as a single episode in July 1960. But CBS executives worried that Reiner would make Petrie seem too Jewish, so Van Dyke was cast instead.</p><p>Reiner likely needed the time spared from playing the lead. Besides acting in and producing the “Van Dyke” series, he wrote or co-wrote dozens of episodes — a feat that exhausted Reiner and amazed the cast and others in the business. Some of the more notable shows: Laura inadvertently revealing to the public that Alan Brady was bald; Rob on a radio marathon, delirious from lack of sleep, calling out to a kitten he’s learned is stuck in a tree; Rob as a jury foreman, clumsily smitten by the attractive defendant (Sue Ann Langdon), and unaware that Laura is in the courtroom.</p><p>“I can explain ... nothing,’’ a sheepish Rob later tells his wife. </p><p>"Although it was a collaborative effort,″ Van Dyke wrote in “My Lucky Life In and Out of Show Business, a memoir published in 2011, ``everything about the show stemmed from his (Reiner’s) endlessly and enviably fascinating, funny, and fertile brain and trickled down to the rest of us.″ On Tuesday, Van Dyke called Reiner “kind, gentle, compassionate, empathetic and wise."</p><p>Reiner and Co. had parodied current events and popular culture on the Caesar program, but for the Van Dyke show he deliberately avoided topical references, hoping it would seem timeless. The sitcom remained highly popular in re-runs, with Laura Petrie’s plaintive “Oh, Rob!” a lasting catchphrase. One famous fan, Orson Welles, was known for rushing to his bedroom in the afternoon so he could be near a TV set when the show was on. First lady Michelle Obama once joked that she preferred watching “Dick Van Dyke” to viewing her husband’s debates.</p><p>Reiner had broken through in television’s early days, before he even owned a TV: He joined “Your Show of Shows” in 1950 after performing in several Broadway plays, and much of his early work came as a “second banana.” Reiner was part of an extraordinary writing team that included Brooks, Neil Simon and Larry Gelbart, and a performing cast featuring Caesar and Imogene Coca. He was never funnier than as an unhinged mechanical figure from a Bavarian clock, never steadier than in a spoof of “This Is Your Life,” in which he is the host and Caesar a surprise honoree who desperately — violently — doesn’t want the honor. “</p><p>As second banana,” Reiner told TV Guide, “I had a chance to do just about everything a performer can ever get to do. If it came off well, I got all the applause. If it didn’t, the show was blamed.” </p><p>Off stage, Reiner and Brooks had a rapport which launched a comic franchise. During the “Show of Shows” years, they started improvising skits which became the basis for “The 2000 Year Old Man.” Reiner was the interviewer, Brooks the old witness to history. </p><p>Reiner: “Did you know Jesus?” </p><p>Brooks: “I knew Christ, Christ was a thin lad, always wore sandals. Hung around with 12 other guys. They came in the store, no one ever bought anything. Once they asked for water.” </p><p>Their routine was an instant favorite at parties, and Reiner recalled that Steve Allen insisted they should turn their banter into a record. “2000 Years with Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks” came out in 1960 and was so popular that Reiner would later tell NPR even Britain’s Queen Mother, “the biggest shiksa in the world,” loved it. The duo updated their shtick over time and won a Grammy in 1998 for their “The 2000 Year Old Man in the Year 2000,” the same year Reiner received the Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for Humor. When the sound system failed at the start of the ceremonies, Reiner called from the balcony, “Does anybody have four double-A batteries?” </p><p>After the Van Dyke show, Reiner appeared in such hit movies as “The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming” and the “Ocean’s Eleven” films that starred George Clooney. He directed George Segal and Ruth Gordon in “Where’s Poppa?”, George Burns in “Oh, God!” and Steve Martin in “The Jerk” and “All of Me.” He took pride in his books, notably “Enter Laughing,” a “bio-novel” which later became a film and Broadway show.</p><p>Reiner was the father of actor-director Rob Reiner, who starred as Archie Bunker’s son-in-law on “All in the Family” and directed “When Harry Met Sally...” Rob Reiner said in a tweet Tuesday that his “heart is hurting. He was my guiding light.”</p><p>Carl Reiner, a son of Jewish immigrants, was born in 1922 in New York City, and raised in a three-room apartment. He loved to mimic voices and tell jokes, and, after high school, attended drama school. He then joined a small theater group. “It was a terrific experience, but I wasn’t getting any money for it,” he told the Akron Beacon Journal in 1963. “I got uppity one day — after all, the audience was paying from 22 to 88 cents for admission — and I demanded to be paid. They settled for $1 a performance and I ... became their highest-priced actor.” </p><p>During World War II, Reiner served in the Army and toured in GI variety shows. After the war, he landed several stage roles, breaking through on Broadway in “Call Me Mister.” He married Estelle Lebost, in 1943. Besides son Rob, the couple had another son, Lucas, a film director; and a daughter, Sylvia, a psychoanalyst and author. Estelle, who died in 2008, had a memorable role in “When Harry Met Sally...” — as the woman who overhears Meg Ryan’s ersatz ecstasy in a restaurant and says, “I’ll have what she’s having.” </p><p>Reiner, winner of multiple Emmys and other awards, was in the business for life. In the 1990s, he won an Emmy by reprising Alan Brady for an episode of “Mad About You” and more recently made appearances on “Two and a Half Men” and “Hot in Cleveland.” In the 21st century, he was writing books and commenting daily through his Twitter feed, venting anger at the presidency of Donald Trump.

I’m not sure what went into that decision making,” Dr. Anthony Fauci told a Senate panel. “I think in the confines of an airplane that becomes even more problematic.”</p><p>Several U.S. airlines say they are limiting capacity on planes to between 60% and 67% of all seats. However, United Airlines never promised to leave seats empty, and American said last week that starting Wednesday it would drop its effort to keep half of all middle seats empty.</p><p>“When they announced that the other day obviously there was substantial disappointment with American Airlines," said Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “I can say this is under critical review by us at CDC. We don’t think it’s the right message.”</p><p>Fauci, the top infectious disease expert at the National Institutes of Health, and Redfield made the comments in response to questioning by Sen. Bernie Sanders during a Senate health committee hearing. Sanders, an independent from Vermont, pressed the officials on how full flights square with the message from public health experts that people should stay six feet apart to prevent transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19.</p><p>American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein said the airline has “multiple layers of protection in place for those who fly with us, including required face coverings, enhanced cleaning procedures, and a pre-flight COVID-19 symptom checklist.” He said American was also giving customers the option of changing their ticket if their flight might be full.</p><p>The CEOs of American and United have said that even with middle seats empty, it is impossible to follow 6-foot social-distancing on a plane, so airlines rely on masks, deep cleaning and air-filtration systems on planes to prevent spreading the virus.</p><p>“It’s less about social distancing and it’s more about the air and quality of air on board the airplane that makes people safe,” said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, who added he had not seen the health officials' comments.</p><p>Airlines are desperate to increase revenue as they try to survive a plunge in air travel that reached 95% during April.</p><p>Many airline flights were nearly empty in the early weeks of the outbreak, with the average dipping to about 10 passengers, according to industry figures. Some days, there were fewer than 100,000 people flying in the United States, a level not seen since the 1950s, except in the days following the September 2001 terror attacks.</p><p>Air travel has increased slowly since mid-April — although it's still down 75% from normal — and some flights have been packed.</p><p>American, which is based in Fort Worth, Texas, plans to increase flights by nearly 60% starting July 7 compared with June, which could help avoid full planes. </p><p>Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Alaska Airlines say they will continue to limit capacity, in some cases through September. Budget carrier Spirit Airlines does not.</p><p>___</p><p>David Koenig reported from Dallas.

Mayor Bill de Blasio supports the $88.2 billion spending plan and Council Speaker Corey Johnson said he was confident it would pass the council, but he expected a lot of “no” votes from members who want to cut more from police.</p><p>The vote comes at an extraordinary moment when the nation's biggest city is grappling with a $9 billion revenue loss due to the coronavirus pandemic and simultaneously with pressure to cut back on policing and invest more in community and social programs.</p><p>Protesters have been <a href="https://apnews.com/14b30e7c03e1d0ee1b8a1604eaa2f923">camped outside City Hall</a>, insisting that the city slash $1 billion from the New York Police Department’s budget amid a nationwide campaign to “defund” police — a movement animated by outrage over the deaths of George Floyd and other Black Americans at the hands of police.</p><p>The proposal did little to assuage the demonstrators. Many said they intended to stay outside City Hall indefinitely.</p><p>“We are being gaslit," said activist Jawanza James Williams. “This movement is about so much more than the $1 billion, and this means they don’t understand what we’re saying.”</p><p>Activists say the budget needs to make a substantial, not symbolic, difference in advancing racial justice and curbing the size and power of the nation's largest police force.</p><p>Five years ago, the City Council — then as now, overwhelmingly Democratic — added nearly 1,300 additional officers to the NYPD. Now, Johnson has said he was wrong to support the expansion, and he lamented Tuesday that he had been unable to negotiate a bigger police budget cut.</p><p>“I am disappointed,” Johnson said at a news conference. “I did my best."</p><p>Council budget leaders said they needed to balance calls to cut policing with residents' concerns about safety.</p><p>“Many in my community have supported police and want police. They just want families and young people to be treated fairly,” said Councilwoman Vanessa Gibson, who represents a Bronx district where over half of residents are Hispanic and about 40% are Black. Gibson said she'd met Tuesday with relatives of a Bronx 17-year-old who was shot and killed Sunday, days after his high school graduation.</p><p>“I don’t want anyone to misunderstand and think that we don’t care and that we have not been working our behinds off to get to a place of equity," while ensuring communities "are not left behind with crime, violence, illegal guns in our communities, no programs, no activities, and no hope for a better tomorrow," Gibson said.</p><p>But some other members said the budget proposal didn't dig deep enough into police spending. Councilman Brad Lander, who planned to vote no, called it “more budget-dancing than meaningful reductions.” </p><p>Cuts would come from canceling a nearly 1,200-person police recruiting class set for next month — though another class in October is scheduled to go forward — as well as halving overtime spending, redeploying officers from administrative functions to patrol and ending police responsibility for school crossing guards and homeless outreach.</p><p>The police department also would give up control over public school security, which the NYPD took over from the Department of Education in 1998. The city has about 5,300 civilian school safety agents. De Blasio said details were being worked out, but the Education Department would train the agents.</p><p>Money would go instead to education, social services in communities hit hard by the virus, and summer youth programs for over 100,000 people.</p><p>Other cuts are being made to the NYPD’s capital budget, including cancelling plans to build a new police precinct in Queens and instead using the money to build a community center. </p><p>“We all understand that we have to answer the concerns of this moment, that people want to see our society progress,” de Blasio, a Democrat, said at a news conference. He vowed the changes would not compromise public safety.</p><p>Police officials didn’t comment Tuesday. Commissioner Dermot Shea has said he was open to giving up school safety and other cuts, as long as the amount of officers on patrol doesn’t shrink.</p><p>The NYPD budget is now around $6 billion, plus several billion dollars more in shared city expenses such as pensions.</p><p>The new plan calls for an ambitious, nearly $300 million cut in police overtime. The department paid out $115 million in overtime just during recent protests over Floyd's May 25 death in Minneapolis.</p><p>The city budget totaled nearly $93 billion when passed last June. Before the virus hit, de Blasio proposed a more than $95 billion spending plan for the budget year that starts Wednesday.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Jim Mustian contributed to this report.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Baseball's minor leagues cancel 2020 seasons</title><link>https://www.local10.com/sports/2020/06/30/baseballs-minor-leagues-cancel-2020-seasons/</link><description>Baseball’s minor leagues have canceled their seasons after Major League Baseball decided not to provide any players to its affiliated teams amid the coronavirus pandemic.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/sports/2020/06/30/baseballs-minor-leagues-cancel-2020-seasons/</guid><dc:creator>Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 00:25:26 +0000</pubDate><media:content height="3489" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/l4RUgOBc-uPfJ7nhVjT8ZWoC4bw=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/CFIFLEHZUNAOLBMQV2AFUUYJIU.jpg" width="5220"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[A cyclist rides past Principal Park, home to the Triple-A minor league baseball Iowa Cubs, Thursday, June 25, 2020, in Des Moines, Iowa.

We don’t have national TV revenues,” National Association president Pat O’Conner said during a digital news conference. “There was a conversation at one point: Well, can we play without fans? And that was one of the shortest conversations in the last six months. It just doesn’t make any sense.”</p><p>O’Conner estimated 85-90% of revenue was related to ticket money, concessions, parking and ballpark advertising. The minors drew 41.5 million fans last year for 176 teams in 15 leagues, averaging 4,044 fans per game.</p><p>MLB teams are planning for a 60-game regular season and most of their revenue will derive from broadcast money.</p><p>“I had a conversation with the commissioner, and we weren’t unable to find a path that allowed us to play games,” O'Conner said. “It wasn’t an acrimonious decision on our part.”</p><p>O'Conner said many minor league teams had received money through the federal Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act. </p><p>“That was a Band-Aid on a hemorrhaging industry,” he said. “Many of our clubs have gone through one, two, maybe three rounds of furloughs. In our office here, we’ve had varying levels of pay cuts between senior management, staff, and we’ve furloughed some individuals, as well, and are just about to enter in a second round of furloughs.”</p><p>He hopes for passage of <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7023/text"> H.R. 7023,</a> which would provide $1 billion in 15-year federal loans from the Federal Reserve to businesses that had 2019 revenue of $35 million or less and “have contractual obligations for making lease, rent, or bond payments for publicly owned sports facilities, museums, and community theaters.”</p><p>In addition, the Professional Baseball Agreement between the majors and minors expires Sept.. 30, and <a href="https://apnews.com/0f4779c5e306b2aea711d8793e648270">MLB has proposed reducing the minimum affiliates</a> from 160 to 120. </p><p>“There’s no question that what the pandemic has done is made us somewhat weaker economically,” O'Conner said. “I don’t think it’s challenged our resolve. I don’t think it’s impacted our desire to stick together and get a good deal.”</p><p>There have not been substantive talks for about six weeks.</p><p>“There are very many teams that are not liquid, not solvent, not able to proceed under normal circumstances, and these are anything but normal circumstances given the PBA and the uncertainty of the future for some of these ballclubs,” O’Conner said. “So I think the coronavirus has really cut into many clubs’ ability to make it. And I think that we’re looking at without some government intervention, without doing something to take on equity partners, you might be looking at half of the 160 who are going to have serious problems.”</p><p>MLB already has told clubs to retain expanded 60-player pools, of which 30 players can be active during the first two weeks of the season starting in late July.</p><p>Conner said the financial impact of the pathogen might extend until 2023.</p><p>“As serious as the threat from Major League Baseball was,” O'Conner said, “this threat from the coronavirus, it transcends any list that anybody wants to make with respect to the possibility of teams not being around in the future.”</p><p>___</p><p>More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Judge temporarily blocks tell-all book by Trump's niece</title><link>https://www.local10.com/entertainment/2020/06/30/judge-temporarily-blocks-tell-all-book-by-trumps-niece/</link><description>A New York state judge has temporarily blocked publication of a tell-all book by President Donald Trump's niece after the president's brother sued to stop it.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/entertainment/2020/06/30/judge-temporarily-blocks-tell-all-book-by-trumps-niece/</guid><dc:creator>Larry Neumeister, Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 00:21:09 +0000</pubDate><media:group><media:content height="831" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/hlMsPxk6OyeB1Ye9dZnPFD8wSWg=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/Z6TP26Y76ZDFDMZD3S6UNCLRWA.jpg" width="1223"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[FILE - In this Nov. 3, 1999 file photo, Robert Trump, left, joins real estate developer and presidential hopeful Donald Trump at an event in New York.

Greenwald in Poughkeepsie, New York, issued an order requiring the niece, Mary Trump, and her publisher to explain why they should not be blocked from publishing the book: “Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man.” A hearing was set for July 10.</p><p>The book, scheduled to be published in July, was written by Mary Trump, the daughter of Fred Trump Jr., the president’s elder brother, who died in 1981.

Circuit Judge James Jamo promised to move quickly but made no immediate ruling.</p><p>That means <a href="https://apnews.com/6cc3ab37b6b8a06db1189ab62cedb318">Line 5 </a> — which carries 23 million gallons of crude oil and natural gas liquids daily between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario — will remain closed for now.</p><p>The 645-mile-long (1,038-kilometer-long) pipeline supplies refineries in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec.</p><p>Enbridge said halting its flow even temporarily threatens fuel supplies in those areas, while the state of Michigan and environmental groups contend a major spill would do considerably worse economic damage.</p><p>“There is a serious risk of harm ... to many communities that potentially endangers the livelihood of many people and businesses as well as the natural resources,” Robert Reichel, representing state Attorney General Dana Nessel's office, said during the online court hearing.</p><p>Enbridge filed an application in April with the Public Service Commission to relocate the underwater section of Line 5 into the proposed tunnel.</p><p>The company asked the commission to approve the plan immediately, arguing that the agency in effect had already given permission by allowing the original Line 5 in 1953. But during an online meeting, the panel disagreed on a 3-0 vote.</p><p>Members concluded that the proposed tunnel pipe “differs substantially” from the twin pipes that were laid 67 years ago, requiring a new easement and a 99-year lease of public trust property.</p><p>The project "involves important factual, policy and legal issues best resolved through a proceeding that includes discovery, comprehensive testimony and evidence to provide a robust record,” the commission said in a statement. It scheduled a public hearing for Aug. 24.</p><p>Enbridge's argument that the commission didn't need to conduct an extensive study of the plan drew opposition from Nessel and numerous members of the public who submitted written comments and spoke during the meeting.</p><p>“Enbridge has already shown that they cannot be trusted,” said Sean McBrearty of the environmental coalition Oil &amp; Water Don't Mix. The public service commission, he said, “must thoroughly study this proposal and its potential impacts on our water and climate before making their final ruling.”</p><p>Enbridge spokesman Ryan Duffy said the company “respects the Michigan Public Service Commission's decision and we look forward to the next steps in the regulatory process.”</p><p>During the court hearing, Enbridge urged Jamo to let Line 5 reopen, saying state governments have no authority to regulate interstate pipelines. That power rests with the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, which has concluded that one of the dual pipes can operate safely, attorney David Coburn said.</p><p>Nessel's case “is based on fear, not facts,” Coburn said. “And her fear is not warranted by the facts here.”</p><p>Enbridge agrees one of the underwater pipes should remain closed temporarily as it investigates why a support that holds it in place was recently found bent. It likely was struck by an anchor or other object pulled by a “moderate-sized vessel," attorney William Hassler said, adding that the pipe itself was not damaged.</p><p>The second pipe, which lies about 1,200 feet (366 meters) away, was not harmed and can carry oil safely, Hassler said.</p><p>Reichel countered that the easement Michigan granted Enbridge to place the pipelines on the bottom of the straits authorizes the state to ensure the company is operating them in a “reasonably prudent” manner.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>With a pen stroke, Mississippi drops Confederate-themed flag</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/national/2020/06/30/governor-to-retire-mississippis-confederate-themed-flag/</link><description>Mississippi Gov.

Solis</media:credit></media:content></media:group><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With a stroke of the governor’s pen, Mississippi is retiring the last state flag in the U.S. with the Confederate battle emblem — a symbol that’s widely condemned as racist.</p><p>Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed the historic <a href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/2020/pdf/history/HB/HB1796.xml"> bill</a> Tuesday at the Governor's Mansion, immediately removing official status for the 126-year-old banner that has been a source of division for generations.</p><p>“This is not a political moment to me but a solemn occasion to lead our Mississippi family to come together, to be reconciled and to move on," Reeves said on live TV just before the signing. “We are a resilient people defined by our hospitality. We are a people of great faith. Now, more than ever, we must lean on that faith, put our divisions behind us, and unite for a greater good.”</p><p>Mississippi has faced increasing pressure to change its flag since protests against racial injustice have focused attention on Confederate symbols in recent weeks.</p><p>A <a href="https://apnews.com/1d4969cb533fb6ab7fe381fb5855c256">broad coalition of legislators</a> on Sunday passed the landmark legislation to change the flag, capping a weekend of emotional debate and decades of effort by Black lawmakers and others who see the rebel emblem as a symbol of hatred.</p><p>Among the small group of dignitaries witnessing the bill signing were Reuben Anderson, who was the first African American justice on the Mississippi Supreme Court, serving from 1985 to 1991; Willie Simmons, a current state Transportation Commissioner who is the first African American elected to that job; and Reena Evers-Everette, daughter of civil rights icons Medgar and Myrlie Evers.</p><p>Medgar Evers, a Mississippi NAACP leader, was assassinated in the family's driveway in 1963. Myrlie Evers was national chairwoman of the NAACP in the mid-1990s and is still living. </p><p>“That Confederate symbol is not who Mississippi is now. It’s not what it was in 1894, either, inclusive of all Mississippians,” Evers-Everette said after the ceremony. "But now we’re going to a place of total inclusion and unity with our hearts along with our thoughts and in our actions.”</p><p>Reeves used several pens to sign the bill. As he completed the process, a cheer could be heard from people outside the Governor's Mansion who were watching the livestream broadcast on their phones. Reeves handed the pens to lawmakers and others who had worked on the issue.</p><p>The Confederate battle emblem has a red field topped by a blue X with 13 white stars. White supremacist legislators put it on the upper-left corner of the Mississippi flag in 1894, as white people were squelching political power that African Americans had gained after the Civil War.</p><p>Critics have said for generations that it’s wrong for a state where 38% of the people are Black to have a flag marked by the Confederacy, particularly since the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups have used the symbol to promote racist agendas. </p><p>Mississippi voters chose to keep the flag in a 2001 statewide election, with supporters saying they saw it as a symbol of Southern heritage. But since then, a growing number of cities and all the state’s public universities have abandoned it.</p><p>Several Black legislators, and a few white ones, kept pushing for years to change it. After a white gunman who had posed with the Confederate flag killed Black worshipers at a South Carolina church in 2015, Mississippi’s Republican speaker of the House, Philip Gunn, said his religious faith compelled him to say that Mississippi must purge the symbol from its flag.</p><p>The issue was still broadly considered too volatile for legislators to touch, until the police custody death of an African American man in Minneapolis, George Floyd, set off weeks of sustained protests against racial injustice, followed by calls to take down Confederate symbols.</p><p>A groundswell of young activists, college athletes and leaders from business, religion, education and sports called on Mississippi to make this change, finally providing the momentum for legislators to vote.</p><p>Before the bill signing Tuesday, state employees raised and lowered several of the flags on a pole outside the Capitol. The secretary of state's office sells flags for $20 each, and a spokeswoman said there has been a recent increase in requests.</p><p>During recent news conferences, Reeves refused to say whether he thought the Confederate-themed flag properly represents present-day Mississippi, sticking to a position he ran on last year, when he promised that if the flag design was going to be reconsidered, it would be done in another statewide election.</p><p>Now, a commission will design a new flag that cannot include the Confederate symbol and must have the words “In God We Trust.” Voters will be asked to approve it in the Nov. 3 election. If they reject it, the commission will draft a different design using the same guidelines, to be sent to voters later.</p><p>Reeves said before signing over the flag's demise, “We are all Mississippians and we must all come together. What better way to do that than include ‘In God We Trust’ on our new state banner."</p><p>He added: “The people of Mississippi, black and white, and young and old, can be proud of a banner that puts our faith front and center. We can unite under it.

The judge asked if she understood the allegations and that if convicted she could be sentenced to up to 10 years behind bars. Daybell, who wiped her eyes occasionally with a tissue, answered “yes.” </p><p>Daybell is already charged with abandoning or deserting 7-year-old Joshua “JJ” Vallow and 17-year-old Tylee Ryan, but because police found their remains buried in her husband's yard, it's not clear if those allegations will stand. She's also charged with obstructing a police investigation, asking a friend to lie to police on her behalf and contempt of court for failing to follow a order to produce the kids.</p><p>Daybell’s attorney has indicated that she intends to defend herself against the charges, but she hasn't yet had a chance to enter a plea.</p><p>Her husband, Chad Daybell, was charged this month with concealing evidence by destroying or hiding the children's bodies. He's pleaded not guilty. </p><p>Prosecutors are using the same behavior alleged in Lori Daybell’s older charges to support the conspiracy charge, saying she aided Chad Daybell’s efforts to hide the bodies by asking her friend to lie to police about JJ’s whereabouts and lying to police herself when she told them JJ was in Arizona and Tylee was attending college. </p><p>Authorities have not yet said how exactly the children died or who caused their deaths. Court documents suggest JJ was buried in a pet cemetery on Chad Daybell's property and that Tylee's remains were dismembered and burned. Investigators found the remains by tracking the movements of Lori Daybell's brother, Alex Cox, using cellphone data. Authorities searched Chad Daybell's home again Monday but haven't said what they were looking for. </p><p>Cox is also dead, succumbing to an apparent blood clot in his lung at his home in Arizona last December. In the newest court documents filed in Lori Daybell's conspiracy case, Rexburg police Lt. Ron Ball wrote that Cox also was involved in the conspiracy to hide the kids' remains by taking JJ to Chad Daybell's property the day the child was buried and by later telling police the boy was visiting his grandparents in Louisiana. </p><p>The documents also reference claims that the Daybells believed dark spirits, or “zombies,” would possess people. Lori Daybell reportedly told her friend Melanie Gibb at different times in 2019 that both JJ and Tylee had become zombies. Gibb said the Daybells also believed the only way to rid a person of a dark spirit was by killing them so the person could be at rest in the afterlife.</p><p>“Gibb was informed by Vallow that when a person became a ‘zombie,’ their original spirit left their body and entered ‘limbo’ and is trapped and cannot progress to ‘paradise,’” Ball wrote in an affidavit. “Vallow then informed Gibb that for the person’s original spirit to be freed from limbo the person’s physical body had to die. Despite the teaching that a physical body needed to die, Gibb reports she was never told by Vallow or Daybell that they planned to carry out a physical killing themselves.”</p><p>The complex case began last summer with Cox shooting and killing Lori's estranged husband, Charles Vallow, in suburban Phoenix in what he asserted was self-defense. Vallow was seeking a divorce, saying Lori believed she had become a god-like figure who was responsible for ushering in the biblical end times. </p><p>Shortly after Vallow’s death, Lori and the children moved to Idaho, where Chad Daybell lived. He ran a small publishing company, putting out many fiction books he wrote about apocalyptic scenarios loosely based on the theology of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He also recorded podcasts about preparing for the apocalypse, and friends said he claimed to be able to receive visions from “beyond the veil.”</p><p>He had been married to Tammy Daybell, who died in her sleep last October of what her obituary said were natural causes. Authorities grew suspicious when Chad Daybell married Lori just two weeks later, and they had Tammy Daybell’s body exhumed in Utah in December. The results of that autopsy have not been released.</p><p>Police began searching for Tylee and JJ in November after relatives raised concerns. Police say the Daybells lied to investigators about the children’s whereabouts before quietly leaving Idaho. They were found in Hawaii months later.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>UAW, prosecutor consider a monitor for avoiding corruption</title><link>https://www.local10.com/business/2020/06/30/uaw-prosecutor-consider-a-monitor-for-avoiding-corruption/</link><description>A federal prosecutor and the United Auto Workers president are looking at using an independent monitor to avoid a repeat of a recent corruption scandal.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/business/2020/06/30/uaw-prosecutor-consider-a-monitor-for-avoiding-corruption/</guid><dc:creator>Tom Krisher, Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 23:37:33 +0000</pubDate><media:content height="3648" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/8exMYyONuMNkUSTXavoqCrakKD0=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/PKVUXR4JEJCTDDJ3R6LYRO3MKA.jpg" width="5472"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[FILE - In this Nov. 6, 2019, file photo, Rory Gamble, acting head of the United Auto Workers union, answers questions in Southfield, Mich.

The meeting was held as the union tries to reform itself and hold off a possible federal takeover.</p><p>Ten union officials have pleaded guilty in the scandal, with some spending thousands in union money for golf, lodging and fancy meals. </p><p>Gamble and Schneider also discussed the importance of democracy in the union, according to the statement. Schneider, whose office has been investigating union corruption since 2015, has floated the idea of a government takeover of the UAW and has advocated for direct voting by members to elect union leadership. Currently the union's roughly 400,000 members vote on delegates to a convention, who then vote on a president. </p><p>In the statement, Schneider appeared to back off from the takeover possibility, saying he looks forward to a “mutually agreeable resolution that will protect the interests of the UAW’s members and their families.” Gamble and other union officials oppose a government takeover. </p><p>An independent monitor would give union members the assurance of reforms “so as to reduce the possibility of a recurrence of corruption,” the statement said. Both sides discussed a number of reform options and agreed to meet again in the coming weeks, according to the statement.</p><p>Neither side would comment beyond the statement, other than to say that no date has been set for another meeting.</p><p>Among the union officials to plead guilty is former President Gary Jones, who was accused of conspiring with UAW cronies to embezzle more than $1 million. The government said union money was spent on golf, cigars, spas, high-end lodging and booze. </p><p>Former President Dennis Williams has not been charged in the case, but his California home was raided by federal agents last summer. The union said Monday that Williams has repaid $55,000 in inappropriate travel expenses. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Panthers launching behind-the-scenes digital series chronicling team’s return from COVID-19 stoppage</title><link>https://www.local10.com/sports/2020/06/30/panthers-launching-behind-the-scenes-digital-series-chronicling-teams-return-from-covid-19-stoppage/</link><description>Buckle up, hockey fans, because after nearly four months off, the NHL is ready to hit the ground running.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/sports/2020/06/30/panthers-launching-behind-the-scenes-digital-series-chronicling-teams-return-from-covid-19-stoppage/</guid><dc:creator>David Dwork</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 23:32:37 +0000</pubDate><media:content height="720" type="image/jpeg" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/VQL5mtZl0jcWmqRSlDnmPDyUxno=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/2ZO2VOQJHFB37K5QCOKTTUAZPM.jpg" width="1280"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[The Florida Panthers take part in a practice at the Ice Den in Coral Springs.]]></media:description><media:credit role="author">David Dwork</media:credit></media:content><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Buckle up, hockey fans, because after nearly four months off, the NHL is ready to hit the ground running. </p><p>Sort of. </p><p>The NHL is preparing to resume its season after pausing everything in March due to the coronavirus pandemic, and the hope is for all 24 teams participating in the league's Return to Play Plan to enter mandatory training camps in the coming weeks. </p><p>The league moved to Phase 2 of its plan in early June, opening up team facilities to players and limited staff members for voluntary, non-contact workouts in small groups. </p><p>Since that time, around half of the Florida Panthers roster has been taking part in Phase 2 at the Ice Den in Coral Springs. </p><p>The NHL and NHLPA are hoping to open official training camps on, or around, July 10th.</p><p>According to the league's plan, when the season does resume, Florida will face the New York Islanders in a best-of-5 qualifying round series. </p><p>As Panthers players continue to get back into form and prepare to battle the Islanders, the team is launching a new, behind-the-scenes series that aims to provide an all-access look at how Florida’s players go from pause to playoffs. </p><p>The five-part digital series called ‘Panthers Uncaged’ premieres Wednesday, July 1st at 5 p.m. on the team’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Flapanthers/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, IGTV, <a href="https://www.nhl.com/panthers/video" target="_blank">PanthersVision</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSSc4wVk6telelb58RrLYdg" target="_blank">YouTube</a> pages. </p><p>A link to the YouTube premiere can be found by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HblPw1XZHo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=uncaged1" target="_blank">clicking here</a>. </p><p>According to a statement released by the team, "(Panthers Uncaged) will be created with a combination of socially-distant footage, go-pros, Zoom interviews, iPhone footage and non-traditional content capture."</p><p>It will be a welcomed window into the world of the Panthers as they navigate through this completely new and unparalleled experience while preparing to compete for the most sought after trophy in professional sports. </p><p>“We wanted to give our Panthers family a behind-the-scenes look at what our players, trainers and staff are doing to ensure a safe environment as the NHL’s Return to Play plan begins,” Panthers Senior Vice President Shawn Thornton said in a press release. “During these unprecedented times, we aim to provide access into players’ lives to showcase their emotions, perseverance and dedication in their quest to bring the franchise its first Stanley Cup.”</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Famed architect Paul Williams' archive goes to Getty, USC</title><link>https://www.local10.com/entertainment/2020/06/30/famed-architect-paul-williams-archive-goes-to-getty-usc/</link><description>The archive of the late African American architect Paul Revere Williams has been acquired by the University of Southern California School of Architecture and the Getty Research Institute.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/entertainment/2020/06/30/famed-architect-paul-williams-archive-goes-to-getty-usc/</guid><dc:creator>John Rogers, Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 23:27:24 +0000</pubDate><media:content height="2008" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/9LD_-CLVD7cZkPDet8ftG2K5VsU=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/IS5ACLK3MZGS7NYUUHWVQAULLA.jpg" width="3000"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[FILE - This June 28, 1968, file photo, shows the main entrance to the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, Calif.

Smith</media:credit></media:content><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before there was Frank Gehry there was Paul Revere Williams, who shaped the face of Los Angeles throughout much of the 20th century, a time in which he also became known as perhaps the greatest Black architect of his time. </p><p>Now Williams' archives, containing tens of thousands of drawings, blueprints, vintage photographs and other papers once thought lost, have been acquired by the University of Southern California School of Architecture and the Getty Research Institute.</p><p>“Paul Williams was a trailblazing architect whose long career helped shape Los Angeles and Southern California. His archive essentially tells the story of how the modern Southland was built,” Getty Research Institute Director Mary Miller said Tuesday. “Its importance as an aesthetic and educational resource cannot be overstated.”</p><p>The archives contain approximately 35,000 plans, 10,000 original drawings, blueprints, hand-colored renderings, photographs and other materials. They have been cared for by his granddaughter Karen Elyse Hudson, who has published extensively about his work. </p><p> “The collaboration of two such esteemed institutions, the University of Southern California and Getty Research Institute to preserve and further his legacy, would make our grandfather extremely proud," Hudson said.</p><p>Williams began his career in the 1920s, a time when there were few opportunities for Black architects, and indeed segregation affected greatly the way he often did his work. </p><p>He learned to draw upside down so he could sketch across a table for white clients who might be uncomfortable sitting next to him. At construction sites he often kept his hands clasped behind his back as he watched his work being created, so as not to risk making anyone uncomfortable about shaking hands with him. </p><p>He came to be known, Hudson said, as the “architect to the stars,” designing eye-popping homes for Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, among others. </p><p>Creating unique homes for the rich and famous represented only a small part of his work. </p><p>His archives also document his early residential commissions from a 1920s housing boom to landmark mid-century civic buildings. The Los Angeles County Courthouse, Los Angeles International Airport and First African Methodist Church were among the projects he led or worked on. </p><p>He was also chief architect for the Pueblo del Rio neighborhood of South Los Angeles, built in 1940 to house African American defense industry workers. </p><p>Although he mainly worked in Southern California, Williams also was chief architect for the United Nations building in Paris and the Langston Terrace in Washington, D.C., the nation's first federally sponsored public housing.</p><p>He was the first African American member of the American Institute of Architects, its first African American Fellow and the first African American recipient of the institute's Gold Medal, its highest honor. </p><p>It was once believed his archives were lost when a South Los Angeles bank building where they were thought to be stored was burned down in the 1992 riots that followed the acquittal of four white police officers for the beating of Black motorist Rodney King. Although some of Williams' business records were stored there, most of his papers were housed elsewhere. </p><p>Born in Los Angeles in 1894, Williams was orphaned following the death of his father at age 2 and his mother at age 4. He died in 1980 at 85. </p><p>Despite those early hardships he would go on to be hailed as one of the University of Southern California's most distinguished alumni. Milton S.F. Curry, dean of the university's School of Architecture, said Tuesday USC was honored to play a role in the archives' acquisition. </p><p>The archives will be a central feature of the USC Center for Architecture + City Design and the African American Art History Initiative at Getty. They will eventually be made available to scholars and others through a digitalization project that will take several years. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fort Lauderdale officer charged with battery for pushing woman at protest</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/06/30/fort-lauderdale-officer-charged-with-battery-for-pushing-woman-at-protest/</link><description>Steven Pohorence, the Fort Lauderdale police officer who was seen on video pushing a female protester May 31, is being charged with battery, Broward State Attorney Mike Satz announced Tuesday.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/06/30/fort-lauderdale-officer-charged-with-battery-for-pushing-woman-at-protest/</guid><dc:creator>David Selig</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 23:16:02 +0000</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Fort Lauderdale police officer who was seen on video <a href="https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/06/01/video-shows-officer-pushing-woman-during-fort-lauderdale-protests/" target="_blank">pushing a female protester May 31</a> is being charged with battery, Broward State Attorney Mike Satz announced Tuesday.</p><p>Officer Steven Pohorence, 29, is charged with battery for “intentionally touching or striking” the 19-year-old woman by “pushing [the victim] to the ground,” according to court records.</p><p>The video was first obtained by Local 10 News’ Jeff Weinsier from another protester.

As a result of state attorney’s decision to charge Pohorence, Fort Lauderdale Police Chief Rick Magilone said Tuesday night that the officer is now on administrative leave without pay. </p><p>“At the conclusion of the process being led by the State Attorney’s Office, our Office of Internal Affairs will complete an administrative investigation to determine if any departmental policies were violated,” Maglione said in a statement. </p><p>Prosecutors say videos of other incidents of use of force by Pohorence remain under review.

Craig Johnson died Tuesday. He said Johnson was shot multiple times during the Monday attack, including one shot that was “critical.”</p><p>Franklin described Johnson's death as a “tremendous loss” to the police department.</p><p>“His sacrifice will not go unremembered,” he said.</p><p>A patrol car at the division where the officers worked has been covered in flowers, balloons, American flags and handmade signs as a tribute.</p><p>Johnson and rookie officer Aurash Zarkeshan were shot at about 3:30 a.m. Monday during a traffic stop. The suspected gunman, 32-year-old David Anthony Ware, was arrested following a search that lasted more than seven hours.</p><p>The officers were trying to get Ware out of the vehicle, and one officer had already deployed a Taser and pepper spray in an attempt to remove him. Once out, Ware pulled a handgun and fired multiple rounds, Franklin said.</p><p>Zarkeshan had been on patrol for less than six weeks since graduating from the police academy in the spring, the chief said.</p><p>Johnson had joined Tulsa police in 2005 and was promoted to sergeant in 2015, Franklin said.</p><p>“Sgt. Johnson was a good man who made our lives better, who trained his fellow officers to be better,” said Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum.</p><p>Franklin said Johnson was survived by his wife, two young sons and parents. He said Johnson's family had decided to donate his organs.</p><p>A motive for the shooting was unclear. Tulsa police Capt. Richard Meulenberg said Ware had no known bias against the police.</p><p>While Ware was being stopped, police said, he called an “accomplice” who arrived in a separate vehicle and picked him up. Police said that man, Matthew Hall, was arrested later Tuesday in Broken Arrow.</p><p>Ware faces murder and weapons charges, and Hall a faces count of being an accessory murder and a related charge. Both are being held without bond at the Tulsa jail. Court records don’t list an attorney to speak for either of them.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Parents, teachers in Broward County say students should go back to class full-time </title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/06/30/parents-teachers-in-broward-county-say-students-should-go-back-to-class-full-time/</link><description>The Broward County School District has sent out a questionnaire to parents asking what they think school should look like in the fall.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/06/30/parents-teachers-in-broward-county-say-students-should-go-back-to-class-full-time/</guid><dc:creator>Layron Livingston</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 22:47:33 +0000</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Broward County School District has sent out a questionnaire to parents asking what they think school should look like in the fall.</p><p>The district presented four options:</p><p>1) Distance or electronic learning, which is what students have been doing since the pandemic started.</p><p>2) Full-time, in class instruction.</p><p>3) A combination of in-class and virtual learning</p><p>4) Broward virtual school, which many students already participate in, but those programs aren’t affiliated with a specific campus.</p><p>That questionnaire got a lot of parents and teachers riled up.</p><p>Many of them showed up outside the School Board building Tuesday with signs.</p><p>They were chanting and overwhelmingly calling for in-class, five days a week instruction.</p><p>They say there are ways to do it safely, following CDC guidelines.</p><p>The parents and teachers who participated in the protest are concerned about widening learning gaps and future impacts.

Senate Republicans who attended a separate briefing largely defended the president, arguing along with the White House that the intelligence was unverified.</p><p>The intelligence assessments were first reported by The New York Times, then confirmed to The Associated Press by American intelligence officials and others with knowledge of the matter.</p><p>White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Tuesday that Trump had been briefed on the intelligence, a day after saying he hadn't because it had not been verified. McEnany added that there were still reservations within the intelligence community on the veracity of the allegations.</p><p>“Make no mistake. This president will always protect American troops,” she said.</p><p>Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and a small group of other House Democrats met with White House officials as Trump downplayed the allegations. The Democrats questioned why Trump wouldn't have been briefed sooner and pushed White House officials to have the president make a strong statement about the matter.</p><p>House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, one of the Democrats who attended the briefing, said it was “inexplicable” why <a href="https://apnews.com/da9b215d7ca8405d2e664b04b799304e">Trump won’t say publicly that he is working to get to the bottom of the issue and why he won’t call out Putin</a>. He said Trump’s defense that he hadn't been briefed was inexcusable.</p><p>“Many of us do not understand his affinity for that autocratic ruler who means our nation ill,” Schiff said.</p><p>Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., a freshman and former Navy helicopter pilot and Russia policy officer, said White House chief of staff Mark Meadows briefed the group. She said the Democrats told the White House briefers that the president should make a statement.</p><p>“These are very concerning allegations and if they’re true, Russia is going to face repercussions,” Sherrill said. "We really pushed that strongly in the meeting.”</p><p>She wouldn’t say how the White House officials reacted or say if the briefers told the Democrats that in fact Trump had been briefed.</p><p>Trump and his aides set a high bar for briefing a president since it is rare for intelligence to be confirmed without a shadow of doubt before it is presented to senior government decision-makers.</p><p>McEnany declined to say why a different standard of confidence in the intelligence might apply to briefing lawmakers than for bringing information to the president.</p><p>Some House Republicans who were briefed by the White House on Monday also said they left with questions.</p><p>Texas Rep. Mac Thornberry, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said the panel would "leave no stone unturned” in seeking further information. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming insisted there would be “ramifications” for any targeting of Americans.</p><p>But Senate Republicans seemed less concerned and questioned the media reports. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he didn't think Trump should be “subjected to every rumor.”</p><p>“Conclusions, apparently, were not reached," McConnell said.</p><p>The White House was working to schedule a briefing for Wednesday with McConnell, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the top Republicans and Democrats on the two intelligence committees according to a person familiar with the talks. The person declined to be identified because the so-called “Gang of 8” briefing will be classified. That group receives the most sensitive information in regular meetings with administration officials.</p><p>A separate group of Senate Republicans briefed in the White House Situation Room on Tuesday appeared mostly satisfied with the answers they received. Senate Armed Services Chairman Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma said he was “convinced” Trump hadn't known about the intelligence. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said Trump “can’t be made aware of every piece of unverified intelligence.”</p><p>Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Marco Rubio said he believed the U.S. was prepared "to do everything possible to protect our men or women stationed abroad, from a variety of threats."</p><p>Some Republican senators did express frustration.</p><p>Nebraska Republican Ben Sasse, a member of the intelligence panel, said Monday evening that Congress should focus on finding out who knew what, and when, “and did the commander in chief know? And if not, how the hell not?”</p><p>While Russian meddling in Afghanistan isn’t new, officials said Russian operatives became more aggressive in their desire to contract with the Taliban and members of the Haqqani Network, a militant group aligned with the Taliban in Afghanistan and designated a foreign terrorist organization in 2012.</p><p>The intelligence community has been investigating an April 2019 attack on an American convoy that killed three U.S. Marines after a car rigged with explosives detonated near their armored vehicles as they traveled back to Bagram Airfield, the largest U.S. military installation in Afghanistan, officials told the AP.</p><p>Three other U.S. service members were wounded in the attack, along with an Afghan contractor. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. The officials the AP spoke to also said they were looking closely at insider attacks — sometimes called “green-on-blue” attacks — from 2019 to determine if they are also linked to Russian bounties.</p><p>One official said the administration discussed several potential responses, but the White House has yet to authorize any.</p><p>Intelligence officials told the AP that the White House first became aware of alleged Russian bounties in early 2019 — a year earlier than had been previously reported. The assessments were included in one of Trump’s written daily briefings at the time, and then-National Security Adviser John Bolton told colleagues he had briefed Trump on the matter. Bolton declined to comment on that matter, and the White House did not respond to questions.</p><p>The intelligence officials and others with knowledge of the matter insisted on anonymity to discuss the highly sensitive matter.</p><p>Trump’s Democratic general election rival, former Vice President <a href="https://apnews.com/256b1855ec06dcc0cdd7ddcf96602987">Joe Biden, accused the president Monday of a “betrayal” of American troops</a> in favor of “an embarrassing campaign of deferring and debasing himself before Putin.”</p><p>“I’m disgusted,” Biden told donors, as he recalled his late son Beau’s military service. Families of service members, Biden said, “should never, ever have to worry they’ll face a threat like this: the commander in chief turning a blind eye.”</p><p>Asked about the reports on the alleged bounties, Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday, “These claims are lies.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Lisa Mascaro, Alan Fram, and Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Confederate flag losing prominence 155 years after Civil War</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/national/2020/06/30/confederate-flag-losing-prominence-155-years-after-civil-war/</link><description>The Confederate battle flag is losing its place of official prominence in the South 155 years after the end of the Civil War.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/news/national/2020/06/30/confederate-flag-losing-prominence-155-years-after-civil-war/</guid><dc:creator>Jay Reeves, Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 22:45:06 +0000</pubDate><media:group><media:content height="3456" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/OC0nqrN9Ew5_1_ZUvYhwPC2u-3Q=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/IDRVEGKCKZGC5J6MSJAOALODAM.jpg" width="5184"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[FILE - In this Monday, June 29, 2020, file photo, City of Tupelo Community Outreach Coordinator Marcus Gary takes down the Mississippi state flag that flew over the City Hall of Tupelo one last time Monday, June 29, 2020.

Mississippi's was the last state flag to include the design.</p><p>NASCAR, born in the South and still popular in the region, <a href="https://apnews.com/9c334b98452b2c021bcbc98dd5b51841">banned</a> the rebel banner from races earlier this month, and some Southern localities have removed memorials and statues dedicated to the Confederate cause. A similar round of Confederate flag and memorial removals was prompted five years ago by the slaying of nine Black people at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. A white supremacist was convicted of the shooting.</p><p>Make no mistake: The Confederate flag isn't anywhere close to being gone from the South. Just drive along highways where Sons of Confederate Veterans members have erected gigantic battle flags or stop by Dixie General Store, where Bob Castello makes a living selling hundreds of rebel-themed shirts, hats, car accessories and more in an east Alabama county named for a Confederate officer, Gen. Patrick Cleburne.</p><p>“Business is very good right now,” Castello said Monday.</p><p>But even Castello is surprised by how demonstrations over police brutality became a wave that seems to be washing over generations of adoration for the Confederate battle flag by some. He wonders what might happen next.</p><p>“This could go on and on," he said. "There’s just no limit to where they could go with it.”</p><p>The Confederacy was founded in Montgomery in 1861 with a Constitution that prohibited laws “denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves.” The South lost, slavery ended, and Confederate sympathizers almost ever since have argued the war wasn't just about slavery, instead advocating the <a href="https://apnews.com/fd949035729b4bc1a7d08ac0e5d90c17">“lost cause”</a> version centered around state's rights, Southern nobility and honor.</p><p>To some, the Confederate battle flag — with its red background, blue X and white stars — is a down-home symbol of Southern heritage and pride. The band Alabama, one of the top-selling country music groups ever, included the banner on five album covers in the 1980s and '90s while at the height of its popularity.</p><p>Patty Howard, who was visiting a huge carving of Confederate Civil War generals at Georgia's Stone Mountain Park with her husband, Toby, on Monday, said they aren't offended by the flag, but they also don't fly it at their home in Hendersonville, North Carolina.</p><p>“I don’t see it as related to slavery,” said Howard, 71. "To us, it just represents being from the South.”</p><p>But the flag has a dark side. It has been waved for decades by the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and other white supremacists who oppose equal rights. The banner's use by such groups, combined with a widening sense that it is time to retire the symbol of a defeated nation once and for all, has led to change.</p><p>“The argument over the 1894 flag has become as divisive as the flag itself and it’s time to end it," Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said of the state's current flag, which was adopted by lawmakers at a time when white supremacists were actively squelching political power that African Americans had gained after the Civil War.</p><p>Georgia — which added the battle emblem to its state flag in 1956 in response to U.S. Supreme Court decisions to desegregate public schools — adopted a flag without a rebel banner in 2003.</p><p>Alabama flew the battle flag atop its state Capitol until 1993, when it was removed following protests by Black legislators. Additional Confederate flags were removed from around a massive Confederate memorial just outside the building in 2015, when South Carolina also removed its battle flag from the state Capitol grounds after the shooting. </p><p>It has taken longer in Mississippi. Not long after the Charleston shooting, House Speaker Philip Gunn became the state's first prominent Republican to say the Confederate symbol on the state flag was morally offensive and must be changed. People posted signs with the slogan, “Keep the Flag. Change the speaker,” but Gunn was easily reelected twice.</p><p>During the past month, Gunn and Mississippi’s first-year lieutenant governor, Republican Delbert Hosemann, persuaded a diverse, bipartisan coalition of legislators that changing the flag was inevitable and they should be part of it.</p><p>Hosemann is the great-grandson of a Confederate soldier, Lt. Rhett Miles, who was captured at Vicksburg and requested a pardon after the war ended in 1865.</p><p>“After he had fought a war for four years, he admitted his transgressions and asked for full citizenship,” Hosemann said during the debate. “If he were here today, he’d be proud of us.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press reporters Kate Brumback in Stone Mountain, Georgia, and Emily Wagster Pettus in Jackson, Mississippi, contributed to this report.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Coronavirus educational effort goes door to door at Miami-Dade’s hot zones</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/06/30/coronavirus-hot-zones-surge-team-focuses-on-miami-dades-33136-33142-33030-zip-codes/</link><description>The members of the new Surge Teams are going door to door in Miami-Dade County neighborhoods where the coronavirus pandemic has had the most impact.

I think that’s where the weak spots come in,” said Dr. Cindy Prins, a University of Florida epidemiologist. She warned that things are likely to get worse before they get better.</p><p>Hospitals in the new hot spots are already stretched nearly to the limit and are scrambling to add intensive care unit beds for an expected surge in COVID-19 cases in the coming weeks.</p><p>Newly confirmed cases in Florida have spiked over the past week, especially in younger people, who may be more likely to survive the virus but can spread it to the Sunshine State's many vulnerable older residents.</p><p>The state reported more than 6,000 new confirmed cases Tuesday. More than 8,000 were recorded on each of three days late last week. Deaths have climbed past 3,500. Floridians ages 15 to 34 now make up 31% of all cases, up from 25% in early June. Last week, more than 8,000 new confirmed cases were reported in that age group, compared with about 2,000 among people 55 to 64 years old. </p><p>Hospital ICUs are starting to fill up in South Florida, with a steadily increasing number of patients requiring ventilators. Miami’s Baptist Hospital had only six of its 82 ICU beds available, officials said.</p><p>In hard-hit Arizona, hospitals are looking for ways to cram more beds into their facilities and hiring out-of-state nurses. State officials have authorized “crisis standards of care” telling hospitals which patients should get a ventilator or other scarce resources if there is a shortage.</p><p>Dignity Health, which operates several hospitals in the Phoenix area, is converting more areas to treat COVID-19 patients and preparing to put multiple patients in private rooms, spokeswoman Carmelle Malkovich said. It’s bringing nurses from underutilized hospitals in its system to Arizona, and hiring traveling nurses and respiratory therapists throughout July.</p><p>Republican Gov. Doug Ducey shut down bars, movie theaters and gyms and banned groups larger than 10 at swimming pools.</p><p>Air conditioning could be a factor in hot-weather states where new cases have been spiking, because it recirculates air instead of bringing it in fresh from outside, said Dr. Kristin Englund, an infectious-disease physician at Cleveland Clinic. </p><p>“I definitely think the air conditioning and the oppressive heat in the South is going to play a role in this,” she said.</p><p>The coronavirus has been blamed for over a half-million deaths worldwide, including about 130,000 in the U.S., where the number of new cases per day has soared over the past month, primarily in the South and West. </p><p>“I would not be surprised if we go up to to 100,000 a day if this does not turn around, and so I am very concerned,” Fauci said on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Van Johnson, mayor of the tourism-dependent city of Savannah, Georgia, announced he is requiring the wearing of masks, with violators subject to $500 fines. </p><p>Savannah, population 145,000, becomes one of the first cities in Georgia to take such a step. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has largely prohibited local governments from imposing rules stricter than the state's.</p><p>After talking with the governors of Arizona and Texas, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said Tuesday that his state will rein in previously set rules for bars and nightlife. Under the modifications, bars that had been allowed to operate at 25% capacity will be closed for in-person service if they don't serve food. </p><p>The new round of shutdowns across the country is likely to cause another spike in layoffs.</p><p>Nikki Forsberg said she is relying on government loans to keep the Old Ironhorse Saloon, the only bar in the Texas Hill Country town of Blanco, afloat after it was closed for two months beginning in mid-March and then shut down again Friday by the governor’s order.</p><p>She said money got so tight for some of her eight employees during the first shutdown that she told them to go the bar and take whatever they needed — petty cash, toilet paper, even one of the refrigerators.</p><p>“That’s how desperate it got,” she said. “By the time we had opened back up, we had stripped the bar of all the non-liquor inventory."</p><p>Health officials say the next several weeks will be critical in Florida. The Fourth of July, the reopening of Walt Disney World on July 11, and the Republican National Convention in Jacksonville at the end of August promise to draw crowds and create the potential for person-to-person spread.</p><p>While cities like Miami, Fort Lauderdale, St. Petersburg and Sarasota have mandated masks, some people in Florida have been resistant.</p><p>In The Villages retirement community near Orlando, tension has developed among residents who wear masks and those who don't. And the split has been along political lines.</p><p>Ira Friedman, who along with wife, Ellen, is active in the local Democratic Party, said that at first, he would just make an exaggerated cough to get his point across if he saw someone without a mask. But he said he has become more vocal about it as the number of cases has grown.</p><p>“Unfortunately, we don’t find that the Republicans are following the same protocols as we are,” his wife said.</p><p>Elsewhere, the European Union will reopen on Wednesday to visitors from 14 countries — but not the U.S., which has barred most Europeans. The EU also kept its ban in place for visitors from China and from countries such as Russia, Brazil and India where infections are running high.</p><p>Americans make up a big share of Europe’s tourism industry, and summer is a key period. More than 15 million Americans travel to Europe each year, while some 10 million Europeans head across the Atlantic.</p><p>“Americans were 50% of my clientele,” lamented Paola Pellizzari, who owns a mask and jewelry shop on the Saint-Louis island in the heart of Paris and heads its business association. “We can’t substitute that clientele with another.” </p><p>Across the English Channel, things are also headed in reverse in places.</p><p>Britain reimposed a lockdown in Leicester, a city of 330,000 that officials said accounted for 10% of all new coronavirus cases in the nation last week. Stores closed their doors, and schools prepared to send children home.</p><p>___</p><p>Seewer reported from Toledo, Ohio.

Hermens</media:credit></media:content></media:group><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Marine pilot Amy McGrath overcame a bumpier-than-expected Kentucky primary to win the Democratic U.S. Senate nomination Tuesday, fending off progressive Charles Booker to set up a bruising, big-spending showdown with Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.</p><p>Voting ended June 23, but it took a week until McGrath could be declared the winner due to the race’s tight margins and a deluge of mail-in ballots. The outcome seemed a certainty early in the campaign but became tenuous as Booker’s profile surged as the Black state lawmaker highlighted protests against the deaths of African Americans in encounters with police.</p><p>It was a narrow victory for McGrath. She outlasted Booker by 15,149 votes out of more than 544,000 votes cast. Several other candidates attracted tens of thousands of votes. McConnell, a key ally to President Donald Trump, already breezed to victory in the GOP primary in his bid for a seventh term.</p><p>Kentucky switched to widespread absentee voting amid the coronavirus pandemic, and election officials needed days to count ballots. In Lexington, the state's second-largest city, about 6,000 absentee ballots were thrown out on technicalities ranging from unsigned envelopes to detached security flaps, said Fayette County Clerk Don Blevins. </p><p>Since last summer, McConnell and McGrath had looked past their respective primaries to skirmish with each other. Those attacks will now intensify heading into the fall campaign.</p><p>Declaring victory, McGrath reached out to Booker's supporters to try to unite the party for the challenge ahead against McConnell, who has dominated Kentucky's political landscape for decades.</p><p>“There is far too much at stake," McGrath said in a statement. “The differences that separate Democrats are nothing compared to the chasm that exists between us and the politics and actions of Mitch McConnell. He’s destroyed our institutions for far too long."</p><p>McConnell's campaign said McGrath's narrow victory showed her candidacy is damaged heading into the general election. McConnell campaign spokeswoman Kate Cooksey portrayed McGrath as a “tool" for the national Democratic establishment and said the challenger was out of step with Kentucky with her support for abortion rights and “government-run health care."</p><p>Booker conceded later in the day and called on Democrats to dedicate themselves “to the work of beating Mitch, so ... we can get him out of the way." But his statement mentioned McGrath only briefly, focusing instead on his campaign for economic and racial justice.</p><p>“We’ve proven Kentuckians are hungry for a new kind of leadership, one that puts working people and their struggles before corporate special interests and the corrupt politicians who serve them," he said. “We’ve proven you don’t have to pretend to be a Republican to run as a Democrat in Kentucky, and that people want big, bold solutions to the enormous crises our state is facing." </p><p>McGrath has raised prodigious amounts of campaign cash, capitalizing on the disdain national Democrats have for McConnell. It places her in a position to go toe-to-toe with the always-well-funded McConnell.</p><p>Despite her advantages, McGrath sweated out her victory against the hard-charging Booker.</p><p>Booker’s long-shot bid surged amid the national eruption of protests against police brutality. He joined demonstrations in his hometown of Louisville to demand justice for <a href="https://apnews.com/40123de08dd6558acba5cd7cec8f0408">Breonna Taylor</a>, who was fatally shot by Louisville police in her own home. Booker gained the backing of leading national progressives as he supported a universal basic income and Medicare for All — ideas that McGrath resisted.</p><p>McGrath charted a more moderate course inside Democratic politics. She supports adding a public health insurance option as part of the Obama-era Affordable Care Act and supports expanded access to Medicare for people 55 and older.</p><p>She portrays McConnell as an overly partisan, Washington insider who exemplifies what’s wrong with national politics. She accuses McConnell of undermining labor unions, awarding tax cuts for the wealthy and cozying up to pharmaceutical companies while people struggle to afford prescription drugs.</p><p>McConnell accuses her of being too liberal for Kentucky on issues ranging from abortion to border security. He promotes his work with Trump — who remains popular in Kentucky — to appoint conservatives to fill federal court seats. McConnell also plays up his Senate leadership role and his ability to steer federal money back to the Bluegrass State.</p><p>Trump could turn into a focal point in the Senate race.</p><p>McConnell <a href="https://apnews.com/1f2816e8800ec4d85a06d0f233d5f59e">led the effort to defend the president</a> after House Democrats impeached him. McGrath has <a href="https://apnews.com/dd3e7ddb0b62b202c9f3038a509ec202">said she would have voted to convict Trump</a> on both impeachment counts. She accused of the GOP-led Senate of lacking “the guts” to put a check on “out-of-control presidential power.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press Writer Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contributed to this report.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Report shows $480,000 in donations to cover Pence legal aid</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/politics/2020/06/30/report-shows-480000-in-donations-to-cover-pence-legal-aid/</link><description>Donors contributed nearly $480,000 to cover Vice President Mike Pence’s legal expenses from special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 elections.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/news/politics/2020/06/30/report-shows-480000-in-donations-to-cover-pence-legal-aid/</guid><dc:creator>Kevin Freking, Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 22:17:49 +0000</pubDate><media:content height="2260" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/fgbJrdF9LQs-OHUCZf279XN8xh4=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/PQGGS6DOSFHVRFAUPYFLSTMO6U.jpg" width="3395"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Vice President Pence leaves the podium after speaking to the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service at their headquarters in Rockville, Md., Tuesday, June 30, 2020.

The amounts ranged from $100,000 for the top three donors to $25 for the person who is listed as the fund’s trustee, James Atterholt, who served as Pence’s chief of staff from 2014 through 2016 when Pence was governor of Indiana.</p><p>“I believe the vice president is a decent and honorable person but he is not someone of great financial means. I started the trust because I believe significant legal bills should not be the cost of public service,” Atterholt said via email.</p><p>The six-figure donations came from Indiana Pacers owner Herbert Simon of Indianapolis and California apartment developers Michael Hayde and Laura Khouri. Half of the donors came from Pence’s home state.</p><p>The report states the money was used to pay a bill from McGuireWoods LLP.

That rebound followed a 20% drop in the first three months of the year, the market's worst quarter since the 2008 financial crisis. The plunge came as the coronavirus pandemic ground the economy to a halt and millions of people lost their jobs. </p><p>“It's the first time you've had back-to-back (quarters) like this since the 1930s,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. “It's pretty unprecedented.”</p><p>The whiplash that ripped through markets in the second quarter came as investors looked beyond dire unemployment numbers and became increasingly hopeful that the economy can pull out of its severe, sudden recession relatively quickly. The hopes looked prescient after reports during the quarter showed that employers resumed hiring again and retail sales rebounded as governments relaxed lockdown orders meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus.</p><p>The quarter’s gains were ignited by promises of massive amounts of aid from the Federal Reserve and Congress. Low interest rates generally push investors toward stocks and away from the low payments made by bonds, and the Federal Reserve <a href="https://apnews.com/a8327492250826917f4545c850edda4a">has pinned short-term interest rates </a> at their record low of nearly zero. </p><p>But most of Wall Street says not to expect anything close to a repeat of the rocking second quarter. A rise in infections has several states pausing their lifting of restrictions. The surge in confirmed new cases, which has prompted the European Union to <a href="https://apnews.com/b42fb52eaa5ba19956cca0c7aabd9a52">bar U.S. travelers from entry</a>, is seeding doubts that the economic recovery can happen as quickly as markets had forecast. That helps explain why the market’s momentum cooled somewhat in June.</p><p>On Tuesday Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, warned that the number of daily new reported infections could surge to 100,000 if Americans don’t start following public health recommendations.</p><p>Beyond the coronavirus, analysts also point to the upcoming <a href="https://apnews.com/256b1855ec06dcc0cdd7ddcf96602987">U.S. elections </a> and other risks that could upset markets. If Democrats sweep Congress and the White House, which many investors see as at least possible, it could mean higher tax rates, which could weaken corporate profits. </p><p>The S&amp;P; 500 gained 47.05 points to 3,100.29 on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 217.08 points, or 0.9%, to 25,812.88. It had briefly been down 120 points. The Nasdaq composite climbed 184.61 points, or 1.9%, to 10,058.77. </p><p>The S&amp;P; 500 has rallied back to within nearly 8.4% of its record set in February, after being down nearly 34% in late March. At one point earlier this month, it had climbed as close as 4.5%.</p><p>Technology, health care and financial companies powered much of the market’s broad gains Friday. The buying accelerated after a report showed stronger-than-expected improvement in consumer confidence this month.</p><p>“Broadly speaking, the market is reacting to economic data that is better than expected,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.</p><p>Schutte said the market is being supported by the likelihood that there won’t be a nationwide shutdown again, aggressive monetary policy and hopes for a vaccine sooner rather than later. “The path of least resistance is still two steps forward, one step back,” he said.</p><p>The quarter featured steady gains in technology stocks, which climbed 27.6%, second only to the consumer discretionary sector's 30.2% gain. And airlines and cruise operators traded wildly after being battered for much of the first quarter.</p><p>Apple, once again the most valuable company in the S&amp;P; 500, gained 43.5% for the second quarter, American Airlines climbed 7.2% for the quarter, while Royal Caribbean Cruises vaulted 56.4%. Still, they each remain down nearly 60% for the year.</p><p>Crude oil had a similar rebound as stocks through the second quarter, though it’s still well below where it was before the pandemic struck. Energy companies mounted a solid comeback, with three of them — Apache, Halliburton and Marathon Oil — showing the biggest percentage gains in the S&amp;P; 500 for the quarter. </p><p>A barrel of U.S. crude oil slid 43 cents to settle at $39.27 Tuesday, but it’s still nearly double where it was at the end of the first quarter. It’s also in a different world from April, when prices in one corner of the U.S. crude market briefly went below zero amid worries that collapsing demand would leave nowhere to store all the unused oil. Brent crude oil fell 56 cents to settle at $41.15 a barrel.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.66% from 0.63% late Monday. It too has rallied back from its lows when recession worries were at their height. It set a record low in March when it briefly dipped below 0.50%, according to Tradeweb. The yield tends to move with investors' expectations for the economy and inflation. </p><p>European stocks closed mixed, and Asian markets finished higher.</p><p>___</p><p>AP Business Writer Yuri Kageyama contributed.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Republicans, with exception of Trump, now push mask-wearing</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/politics/2020/06/30/republicans-with-exception-of-trump-now-push-mask-wearing/</link><description>In Republican circles -- with the notable exception of the man who leads the party -- the debate about masks is over: It’s time to put one on.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/news/politics/2020/06/30/republicans-with-exception-of-trump-now-push-mask-wearing/</guid><dc:creator>Aamer Madhani And Laurie Kellman, Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 22:10:01 +0000</pubDate><media:group><media:content height="2661" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/5xxJwCUGpy_PbWU9jfggBJPSWz8=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/FIE6XZIPEVCGBOAIKFQFFFAMRI.jpg" width="3996"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., listens to questions during a news conference following a GOP policy meeting on Capitol Hill, Tuesday, June 30, 2020, in Washington.

Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, on Tuesday bluntly called on Trump to start wearing a mask, at least some of the time, to set a good example.</p><p>"Unfortunately, this simple, lifesaving practice has become part of a political debate that says: If you’re for Trump, you don’t wear a mask. If you’re against Trump, you do,” Alexander said. </p><p>It’s a rare break for Republicans from Trump, who earlier this month told the Wall Street Journal that some people wear masks simply to show that they disapprove of him. And the Republican nudges for the public -- and the president -- to embrace mask-wearing are coming from all corners of Trump’s party and even from friendly conservative media.</p><p>Both Vice President Mike Pence and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in recent days have urged Americans to wear one when they are unable to maintain social distance. Sen. Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, told reporters it would be “very helpful” for Trump to encourage mask usage. </p><p>“Put on a mask -- it’s not complicated," McConnell, R-Ky., urged Americans during his weekly news conference Tuesday.</p><p>Last week, Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming tweeted a photo of her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, wearing a disposable mask and a cowboy hat. She included the message: “Dick Cheney says WEAR A MASK #realmenwearmasks,” a hashtag that echoed words spoken earlier by the Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>Steve Doocy, co-host of a Trump friendly morning show “Fox &amp; Friends,” said during an interview with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy that he doesn’t “see any downside in the president being seen more often wearing it.”</p><p>McCarthy, R-Calif., responded that, for the upcoming holiday, “we could all show our patriotism with a red, white and blue mask.”</p><p>Jacksonville, the Florida city where Trump is scheduled to accept his renomination as Republicans' presidential candidate in August, announced a mask requirement for indoor public spaces this week. The president’s eldest son said the new requirements were no big deal.</p><p>“You know, I don’t think that it’s too complicated to wear a mask or wash your hands and follow basic hygiene protocols,” Donald Trump Jr. told Fox Business on Tuesday.</p><p>Trump aides have defended the president’s refusal to wear a mask by noting that he is regularly tested for the coronavirus, as are his aides. Those outside the administration -- including White House visitors and members of the media who are in close proximity to him and Pence -- are also tested. </p><p>White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany didn’t directly address Republican calls for Trump to wear a mask in public more often, but noted that the president has said in the past he has no problem wearing one when necessary.</p><p>But even with safeguards, the virus has found its way into the White House. A top aide to Pence, as well as a military valet to Trump, in May tested positive for the virus.</p><p>Still, mask usage remains rare in the West Wing, said Rep. Brad Sherman, a California Democrat who attended an intelligence briefing at the White House on Tuesday with senior members of the president’s staff.</p><p>At the briefing, which he said included about eight White House staffers, only national security adviser Robert O’Brien wore a mask, Sherman said. He added that no one in the secure briefing room was able to maintain 6 feet (1.8 meters) of social distancing, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p><p>“I learned something major, and that is the White House is a mask-free zone,” Sherman told The Associated Press. “The president is consistent. He’s fine with people not wearing masks.”</p><p>Polls show how the partisan divide on masks has seeped into public opinion.</p><p>The vast majority of Democrats think people in their community should wear a mask when they are near other people in public places at least most of the time, including 63% who say they should always, according to a Pew Research Center poll published in early June. Among Republicans, 29% say masks should be worn always, and 23% say they should be worn most of the time. Another 23% say masks should rarely or never be worn. </p><p>Trump has been caught on camera once wearing a mask. But Pence and members of the White House coronavirus task force frequently appear in public wearing masks. </p><p>“If you want the return of college football this year, wear a face covering. If you want a chance at prom next spring, wear a face covering,” Surgeon General Jerome Adams urged Americans.</p><p>Over the course of the crisis, the government has sent mixed messages on masks. As the first COVID-19 cases were identified on U.S. soil, top public health officials insisted masks should be reserved for front-line workers. </p><p>In early April, the CDC issued a recommendation that people wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures were difficult to maintain. </p><p>But Trump immediately undercut the CDC guidance by flatly stating that he wouldn’t be following it, suggesting it would be unseemly for the commander in chief to wear one as he meets with heads of states. </p><p>Other world leaders, including Canada’s Justin Trudeau and France’s Emmanuel Macron, have worn masks in public and urged their citizens to do the same when they can’t maintain social distance</p><p>Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University, says he worries Republican calls for wearing masks “might be too late.”</p><p>“The public has received such mixed messages from the administration,” Gostin said. “I fear we may be stuck with coronavirus until it burns through the American population and leaves hundreds of thousands dead.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Jill Colvin, Darlene Superville and Hannah Fingerhut in Washington contributed to this report.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>High court sparks new battle over church-state separation</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/politics/2020/06/30/high-court-sparks-new-battle-over-church-state-separation/</link><description>Religious freedom advocates are pleased and some secular groups alarmed following a Supreme Court ruling that states must give religious schools the same access to public funding that other private schools receive.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/news/politics/2020/06/30/high-court-sparks-new-battle-over-church-state-separation/</guid><dc:creator>David Crary And Elana Schor, Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 22:07:42 +0000</pubDate><media:content height="3230" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/VgCByIY86IZggpIpFBvi8qztfLk=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/YTGTULUOWRHZTIH7SON372DCVE.jpg" width="4845"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[The U.S. Supreme Court is seen Tuesday, June 30, 2020 in Washington. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)]]></media:description><media:credit role="author">Manuel Balce Ceneta</media:credit></media:content><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Court elated religious freedom advocates and alarmed secular groups with its Tuesday ruling on public funding for religious education, a decision whose long-term effect on the separation of church and state remains to be seen.</p><p>In Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, the high court ruled 5-4 that states must give religious schools the same access to public funding that other private schools receive, preserving a Montana scholarship program that had largely benefited students at religious institutions. </p><p>It prompted a jubilant reaction from the reelection campaign of President Donald Trump, who counts religious conservatives as a core part of his base. The campaign lauded the decision as “a victory for educational freedom,” underscoring its importance for a White House that often spotlights religious liberty. </p><p>Sister Dale McDonald, public policy director for the National Catholic Education Association, said the ruling has the potential to stem nationwide enrollment declines at Roman Catholic schools that are <a href="https://apnews.com/4fe7bd56c238888d9842760236502453">forcing the closure</a> of hundreds of institutions.</p><p>“This is a chance to get public schools and religious schools on equal footing,” McDonald said, adding that the extent of change would depend on how many state legislatures opt to expand tuition assistance. </p><p>Critics assailed the decision as another in a series of setbacks for a principle with long roots in the U.S. legal system. </p><p>It is "the latest in a disturbing line of Supreme Court cases attacking the very foundations of the separation of church and state,” said Daniel Mach, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s freedom of religion program. </p><p>Tuesday’s ruling focused on a program that offered indirect tuition assistance through tax credits rather than direct state aid to religious schools. The court left unresolved the extent to which religious schools may use public funding for explicitly religious activities, such as worship services and religious-education courses. Mach said that issue likely would be the focus of future litigation, given that many religious schools consider doctrinal education to be at the core of their mission. </p><p>Others tracking the Montana case stopped short of predicting a major expansion of state funding for religious education. </p><p>Douglas Laycock, a law professor at the University of Virginia who co-authored a brief supporting the plaintiffs on behalf of multiple religious groups, described the decision as “incremental” and “building cautiously” on a 2017 case that ruled a Missouri church could use a state grant to resurface its playground. </p><p>“But incremental moves have been accumulating since 1986, and what would pretty clearly have been unconstitutional in the ’70s and early ’80s is now, sometimes, constitutionally required,” Laycock wrote in an email. </p><p>At least two faith-based organizations joined secular counterparts in opposing the ruling on principles of church-state separation, saying public money for religious education forces people to fund faiths to which they do not subscribe.</p><p>“Government funding to religious schools requires taxpayers to support religious institutions and beliefs that may violate their own, something the First Amendment was intended to avoid,” Rabbi Jonah Pesner, director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, said in a statement.</p><p>Rachel Laser, president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, contended that many of the religious schools participating in Montana’s program had discriminatory policies.</p><p>“Members of the faith should fund those religious schools, not the taxpayers,” said Laser, who is Jewish. “It would offend my religious freedom to fund a school that requires belief that Jesus Christ is necessary for my salvation.” </p><p>Another attorney who co-authored a brief supporting the plaintiffs, Becket Fund for Religious Liberty vice president and senior counsel Eric Baxter, predicted the ruling will not result in significant new funds flowing to religious schools.</p><p>“Legislatures are not compelled to provide this funding,” Baxter said, pointing to language in Chief Justice John Roberts’ majority opinion saying most states with provisions barring aid to religious schools still let them participate in public scholarship programs.</p><p>“If they do provide this funding to the private sphere,” Baxter said of states, “then they just have to treat everybody equally.”</p><p>Institute of Justice vice president Tim Keller, whose group represented the plaintiffs, told reporters that Idaho, Texas, South Dakota and Missouri were among the states most likely to create school choice programs that include religious education.</p><p>Arizona has had such programs in place for several years, enabling Catholic schools there to reverse enrollment declines that were due at least in part to parents’ inability to afford tuition. </p><p>McDonald, of the Catholic education association, also predicted that the ruling would bring swift changes in Maine and Vermont, where parents have been able to get public funds for tuition at secular private schools, but not at faith-based schools. </p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press reporter Mark Sherman in Washington contributed.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through the Religion News Foundation.

He wasn't expected to pitch in 2020 until at least May, and Eppler confirmed that the coronavirus pandemic hasn't altered the Angels' plans.</p><p>“We'll probably have a little bit more of a governor on him, at least at the outset,” Eppler said. “He's had a number of live (throwing sessions against hitters), but we want to up that intensity a little bit more and put him into a game situation. Just watching how he responds on a day-to-day basis will help guide us to how much we can push down on the gas pedal on him. We're expecting him to be on the mound and stay on the mound and roll through spring training.”</p><p>Manager Joe Maddon said last week that he hoped Ohtani would start roughly once a week on the mound while serving as the Halos' designated hitter in 3-4 games between starts. The Angels could have a six-man rotation for the short season.</p><p>Ohtani batted .286 last season with 18 homers and 62 RBIs and an .848 OPS in 106 games. His production at the plate was nearly identical to his work in 2018, when he was the AL Rookie of the Year while making 10 starts on the mound.</p><p>Eppler said none of the Angels' players are currently intending to opt out of playing in the shortened season. That includes three-time AL MVP Mike Trout, whose wife is due with their first child later this summer.</p><p>Eppler confirmed that first-round pick Reid Detmers will be on the Angels' summer roster as the 56th player, although the left-handed starter hasn't officially yet been added.</p><p>Eppler also went into details on the Angels' adherence to health and safety protocols at Angel Stadium and at Blair Field in Long Beach, where the Angels also will hold their summer camp. The Angels have removed communal couches and tables from their clubhouses in a bid to remind their players of the new realities.</p><p>“Think of the clubhouse as more of a closet,” said Eppler, who has received positive feedback from his players over their safety steps. “It’s where clothes hang. Absent of anything you need to do in the training room or weight room, get outside.”</p><p>___</p><p>More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Coronavirus: Hialeah officials aim to stem flow of new COVID-19 cases in city with numerous long-term care facilities</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/06/30/coronavirus-hialeah-officials-aim-to-stem-flow-of-new-covid-19-cases-in-city-with-numerous-long-term-care-facilities/</link><description>Deaths of patients at long-term care facilities make up more than half of all of the COVID-19 deaths in the state.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/06/30/coronavirus-hialeah-officials-aim-to-stem-flow-of-new-covid-19-cases-in-city-with-numerous-long-term-care-facilities/</guid><dc:creator>Ian Margol</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 21:57:43 +0000</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Deaths of patients at long-term care facilities make up more than half of all of the COVID-19 deaths in the state.</p><p>According to Hialeah's mayor, the city is home to the most long-term care facilities per capita in all of Florida, which is why officials are trying to stem the flow of new COVID-19 cases ravaging them. </p><p>Daylet Collazo gushes about her grandmother, Olga Rodriguez, who was one of the many residents of long-term care facilities in Florida who have been killed by the novel coronavirus. </p><p>"My grandmother was the sweetest, nicest person anyone can ever meet," she said. </p><p>Rodriguez had dementia and couldn’t walk, but otherwise, Collazo describes her as a healthy 81-year-old woman, living at the Hialeah Nursing and Rehabilitation Center.</p><p>"She was strong, she had her talking," said Collazo. "She was such a sweet, little old lady."</p><p>Then, COVID-19 began hitting long-term care facilities in South Florida and, unfortunately, Rodriguez became one of the victims.</p><p>On May 22nd she was hospitalized. Collazo said her grandmother had pneumonia and could barely breathe. About a month later, she passed away.</p><p>Collazo feels that the facility her grandmother was living in could have gotten her emergency medical treatment sooner and done more to help her.</p><p>"When I received the phone call at June 23 at 4:30 in the morning, it was like they killed me, because I received a call from the hospital that she had passed away, because they took her from me, there was no reason," she said. </p><p>In response, the facility sent a statement about the large number of cases they’ve seen, saying in part:</p><p>"Hialeah Nursing and Rehabilitation Center remains committed to the care and safety of our residents and staff, and we continue taking critical steps to keep them protected, following all CDC guidelines and working with our state and local health officials and regulatory partners."</p><p>In Miami-Dade County there have been more than 500 deaths at long-term care facilities, and two out of the three facilities with the highest number of deaths in the entire state are in Hialeah (the third is in Miami Springs). </p><p>Hialeah Mayor Carlos Hernandez said when the pandemic started, staff members at certain facilities were positive for the virus without knowing and spreading it to their patients. </p><p>Now he said more stringent guidelines from the state, as well as a new effort on the city's side, will hopefully see the number of new cases slow down. </p><p>"We all know that these places have been the worst hit and we want to stay ahead of that," Hernandez said. "We've actually formed a task force to assist the state, ACA, in making sure we can identify any place where there is a hot spot."</p><p>State guidelines are that long-term care facility staff be tested for COVID-19 every 14 days, but the City of Hialeah is going to push for them to be tested every five to seven days. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dem climate plan would end greenhouse gas emissions by 2050</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/politics/2020/06/30/dem-climate-plan-would-end-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-2050/</link><description>House Democrats have unveiled a plan to address climate change that would set a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/news/politics/2020/06/30/dem-climate-plan-would-end-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-2050/</guid><dc:creator>Matthew Daly, Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 21:55:38 +0000</pubDate><media:group><media:content height="3457" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/ZPdad_hfXU5b2coyassaiUHyKWA=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/JGADB5TILFGJDDJCXPKBI4WUTM.jpg" width="5185"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., speaks at a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Friday, June 26, 2020.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., calls for dramatic steps to virtually eliminate U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 with a goal of meeting “100% of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable and zero-emission energy sources,” including nuclear power. </p><p>The new plan, put forth Tuesday in a 538-page report, offers similar goals but at a slower pace. It sets a range of targets, including a 45% reduction by 2030 of greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming. </p><p>The plan also would require that by 2035 new cars emit no greenhouse gases, while heavy-duty trucks would eliminate those emissions by 2040. The plan would eliminate overall emissions from the power sector by 2040 and all but eliminate greenhouse emissions from all economic sectors by 2050.</p><p>Supporters say the plan, presented by Democrats on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, by 2050 would save more than 60,000 American lives every year thanks to reduced air pollution, as well as nearly $8 trillion thanks to health and climate benefits.</p><p>"Democrats know the climate crisis is the essential crisis of our time, threatening public health, jobs and the economy, national security and values,'' Pelosi said Tuesday at a Capitol news conference. </p><p>“We are here today to provide hope and vision,'' said Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., chairwoman of the climate panel. She called the Democratic plan a "transformative road map for solving the climate crisis,'' and pledged it would address environmental justice and vulnerable communities that are suffering from the effects of air and water pollution and industrial waste.</p><p>"The health of our families and the air we breathe are at the heart of our plan,'' Castor said, adding that it would create good-paying jobs in solar and wind energy, manufacturing electric vehicles and ensuring that communities are more resilient to flooding, extreme heat, intense hurricanes and wildfires.</p><p>While likely to win approval in the Democratic-controlled House, the plan faces insurmountable opposition in the Republican-controlled Senate. Democrats are hoping to make inaction on climate change by congressional Republicans and the Trump administration a key campaign issue in November’s election.</p><p>GOP lawmakers immediately slammed the plan as a job-killer. The Democratic plan “punishes the American economy” and “gives a free pass to China” to pollute, said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.</p><p>President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have expanded responsible, clean-energy technologies "while the Democrats continue to push radical Green New Deal-like polices that would cripple America’s economy and crush the poorest communities across the globe,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. </p><p>The Democratic plan is similar to one proposed by former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president. Biden's plan also sets a goal for net-zero greenhouse emissions by 2050 and pledges an enforcement mechanism that includes milestone targets no later than 2025.</p><p>A Biden spokesman applauded Pelosi and House Democrats and said that as president, Biden “will work with Congress to implement a bold agenda that addresses the climate emergency, achieves environmental justice and creates good-paying jobs.″ </p><p>The new plan received immediate support from more than 90 outside organizations, including major environmental groups and leaders in environmental justice, agriculture, public health and transportation.</p><p>The Sunrise Movement, a progressive group that helped develop the Green New Deal, said the plan did not go far enough, fast enough to halt climate change.</p><p>"This plan is more ambitious than anything we have seen from Democratic leadership so far, but it still needs to go further to match the full scale of the crisis,'' said Lauren Maunus, the group's legislative manager.</p><p>“There’s nothing to lose by going bigger,'' Maunus said. "Taking action at the scale of the crisis will help lift our economy out of recession and put millions of people back to work building a more just and resilient society.''</p><p>In a sign of the changed political environment, the Democratic plan heavily emphasizes environmental justice and notes that the report’s release comes as the nation is reeling from a cascade of crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic. which has killed more than 120,000 Americans; stay-at-home orders and business closures that have put 40 million Americans out of work; and nationwide protests in response to the police killing of an unarmed Black man, George Floyd. </p><p>Throughout these crises, Trump has "failed to lead the country in a unified and compassionate response, instead choosing to fan the flames of discord and distrust,'' the report said.</p><p>Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, lead author of a 2018 report on climate change for the United Nations, said the House committee’s report got the science correct. “If you want to keep temperatures low, we need to act quickly. The emission cuts required are really quite dramatic, as they say here,” Mahowald said in an email.</p><p>Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann called the report “an excellent starting point” that offers a sensible mix of subsidies for renewable energy and a price on carbon emissions. </p><p>The report was released as the Trump administration pushed a plan to spur production of fossil fuels even higher. In a 56-page report that did not mention the word "climate,'' the Energy Department on Tuesday urged building up four Appalachian states as a petrochemical production and manufacturing hub, while delaying market-driven retirements of the region’s coal plants. The four targeted states — Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky — are the heart of Appalachian energy production. Pennsylvania is a key battleground in the 2020 election, and recent polls show Biden narrowly leading Trump in Ohio.</p><p>Trump has mocked the science of climate change, and his administration has dismantled Obama-era initiatives to cut greenhouse gas emissions, while throwing a series of financial and regulatory breaks to the coal, oil and gas sectors.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Seth Borenstein and Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this report. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Coronavirus in Florida: With eviction protections ending, many who lost their job fear living without a home</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/06/30/coronavirus-in-florida-with-eviction-protections-ending-many-who-lost-their-job-fear-living-without-a-home/</link><description>Countless Floridians are facing uncertainty due to the state’s moratorium on non-payment evictions ending on Wednesday.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/06/30/coronavirus-in-florida-with-eviction-protections-ending-many-who-lost-their-job-fear-living-without-a-home/</guid><dc:creator>Amy Viteri</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 21:51:58 +0000</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Countless Floridians are facing uncertainty due to the state’s moratorium on non-payment evictions ending on Wednesday. </p><p>One South Florida woman told Local 10 News her landlord has already tried to kick her out. </p><p>Adele Penny received a notice to get out of her Hialeah rental home in May, despite an official freeze on evictions for non-payment during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>“It’s like life and death you are going to kick me and my family out on the streets because you can’t get a couple hundred dollars,” she said. </p><p>Penny said her daughters had been helping her make ends meet before the pandemic. She had agreed with her landlord to move out of by March, but then came the novel coronavirus. Both daughters lost their jobs and Penny has been unable to find one. </p><p>Attorney Guerby Noel represents Penny and got her case dismissed. That’s because since March, non-payment eviction cases are suspended under an executive order issued by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. </p><p>"They found themselves in their current situation whereby they are unemployed with no means of actually paying the event through no fault of their own," said Noel. </p><p>The governor extended that order last month, but it’s now set to expire by Wednesday. Unfortunately, for many renters like Penny, the situation has not improved.</p><p>“I don’t know where my fate is, what’s next for me, what do I do now,” Penny said. </p><p>As coronavirus cases continue to climb, Noel predicts so will the number of people out of work, now potentially without any protection to keep them in their homes. </p><p>“There are many landlords out there that are waiting in the wings to file their evictions, and all things point to there being an avalanche of eviction cases for non-payment,” Noel said. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>State budget cuts will affect dozens of South Florida services</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/06/30/state-budget-cuts-will-affect-dozens-of-south-florida-services/</link><description>Gov.

Also influencing the decision were investments in New Mexico movie studios by Netflix and NBCUniversal in recent years, said Tunte Vigil, Tesuque Pueblo’s business development associate.</p><p>“The Pueblo of Tesuque Development Corporation wants to bring different businesses to the pueblo and the market is really open,” Vigil said. “So this is a good opportunity.”</p><p>No productions are happening now and none are planned for the immediate future because the pueblo and most of the state remains under strict COVID-19 business restrictions. But Brown said that that hasn’t stopped potential productions from contacting the pueblo and asking to reserve studio time.</p><p>Cheyenne and Arapaho filmmaker Chris Eyre, a Santa Fe resident and an advisor to Camel Rock Studio, said the studio’s unique aspect is that its former makeup as a casino provides the site with pre-made infrastructure that can be used for filming different types of movie scenes</p><p>“It’s a museum. It’s an opulent hotel lobby. It’s a capitol building,” said Eyer, who directed the 1998 film “Smoke Signals” about two Coeur d'Alene tribal members who travel from Idaho to Arizona to retrieve the remains of their father after he died alone. “There are sorts of interesting standing sets that can be creatively (crafted) for all sorts of scenes.”</p><p>The site also has a set workshop called a mill that can be used by crews to build sets for use inside the casino or on the tribe's land, Eyer said, adding that he could envision movies filmed there that are set in the Middle East or the U.S. Southwest.</p><p>Older movies filmed on the Tesuque Pueblo include the 1955 western “The Man from Laramie” starring James Stewart and the 1988 “Young Guns” with Emilio Estevez and Kiefer Sutherland.</p><p>But Eyer said previous productions had stereotypes about Indigenous people and limited Native American input and that tribal officials hope future productions don't follow in their footsteps. </p><p>The studio is being established at a time when Native American writers including Pulitzer Prize-winning Cheyenne and Arapaho author Tommy Orange and Inupiaq American poet Joan Naviyuk Kane are transforming American Literature — and putting pressure on Hollywood to incorporate more Native American stories.</p><p>Tribal officials plan to create internships and movie training programs for Tesuque Pueblo members and hope that the studio will foster a new storytelling movement, Eyer said.</p><p>“Native Americans are natural storytellers,” he said. “What better place to do it?”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Russell Contreras is a member of the AP’s Race and Ethnicity team.

The shooting by the white officer happened against the backdrop of demonstrations nationwide over police brutality and systemic racism after George Floyd died under a Minneapolis officer’s knee.</p><p>Appearing via teleconference because of the coronavirus, lawyers for Rolfe argued that he is a native Georgian with strong ties to the community who is not at risk of fleeing or failing to show up for court and is not a danger to the community. A prosecutor argued that Rolfe, 27, had committed an unjustified fatal shooting and was a flight risk and might intimidate witnesses.</p><p>Brooks’ wife, Tomika Miller, sobbed throughout an emotional plea to the judge, asking her not to grant bond for Rolfe.</p><p>“I say no to it,” she said. “I say no because, mentally, I’m not able to handle it.”</p><p>Barwick thanked Miller, noting that her appearance required a lot of bravery, but said she found that Rolfe met the conditions required for bond. The judge said Rolfe “is not a flight risk and I do not believe he is a danger to the community."</p><p>The conditions of his bond include wearing an ankle monitor, complying with a curfew, surrendering his passport, not possessing any guns and having no contact with victims, witnesses or Atlanta police officers.</p><p>
<a href="https://apnews.com/e5741e6b7d1a3c9be991201d21b90e13">Police body cameras showed</a> Rolfe and another officer having a calm and respectful conversation with Brooks for more than 40 minutes after complaints that Brooks had fallen asleep in his car in a Wendy’s drive-thru lane on June 12. </p><p>But when officers told him he’d had too much to drink to be driving and tried to handcuff him, Brooks resisted. A struggle was caught on dash camera video. Brooks grabbed one of their Tasers and fled, firing the Taser at Rolfe as he ran away. </p><p>An autopsy found Brooks was shot twice in the back.</p><p>During Tuesday's hearing, one of Rolfe’s attorneys, Noah Pines, denied the district attorney’s accusations that Rolfe shouted “I got him!” and kicked Brooks after shooting him. Pines called on Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard to release video of the alleged kick. Howard had made the allegations when he <a href="https://apnews.com/f3c3747e6d8c0bd63ba7c57c6d363868">announced the charges</a> five days after Brooks' death.</p><p>Executive Assistant District Attorney Clint Rucker said video footage shows Rolfe’s kick and a witness confirmed that it happened.</p><p>Rolfe was fired shortly after the shooting and the other officer, Devin Brosnan, was placed on desk duty. The <a href="https://apnews.com/4a297ba576eb60e77e8c302686a877e7">police chief stepped down</a> less than 24 hours after the shooting.</p><p>Rolfe now faces 11 charges in all. Felony murder is punishable by a minimum sentence of life in prison, with or without the possibility of parole. Brosnan, 26, is charged with aggravated assault and violating his oath and is free on bond. </p><p>Lawyers for both men have said their actions were justified.</p><p>Rolfe’s attorneys had asked the judge for a $50,000 signature bond, which would have meant he wouldn’t have had to pay anything unless he failed to show up for court.</p><p>Rolfe's attorneys gave the judge nearly 30 letters attesting to his good character. They also said he was a police officer doing his job, not someone who went out with the intention of committing a violent crime.</p><p>“If Garrett Rolfe isn't entitled to a bond under the statute, then nobody is, nobody for a murder case,” Pines said.</p><p>Rucker had asked the judge to deny bond, but when she asked what bond would be reasonable if she chose to grant one, he said $1 million with a string of conditions.</p><p>Rucker argued that Brooks was running away and posed no threat when he was shot in the back.</p><p>In a statement, attorneys for Brooks' family said they were “disappointed” by the judge's ruling, but said it was “just one step in the long quest for justice for Rayshard.” </p><p>"Rather than looking at this process as a series of ‘wins’ or ‘losses,’ it’s imperative that we continue to push for systemic change within our criminal justice system," attorneys L. Chris Stewart and Justin Miller said. “From hate crime laws being passed to increasing oversight of members of law enforcement, our job is to ensure that positive change comes from this tragic situation.”</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pompeo urges UN arms embargo on Iran's `terrorist regime' </title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/world/2020/06/30/pompeo-urges-un-arms-embargo-on-irans-terrorist-regime/</link><description>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is calling Iran “the world’s most heinous terrorist regime” and urging the U.N.

Security Council on Tuesday to extend the U.N. arms embargo against Tehran, which expires in October, and reject “extortion diplomacy.”</p><p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif countered calling President Donald Trump’s administration “an outlaw bully” that is waging “economic terrorism” on his country to satisfy domestic constituencies and “personal aggrandizement.”</p><p>He called for the U.S. to compensate the Iranian people for the damage and vehemently opposed any extension of the arms embargo, warning that Iran’s options “will be firm” if it is maintained and the U.S. will bear full responsibility. </p><p>The United States has circulated a draft Security Council resolution to extend the arms embargo indefinitely, and Pompeo said the United States’ “overwhelming preference” is to work with its 15 members to adopt it. </p><p>But he indicated that if the resolution isn’t approved, which is likely because of Russian and Chinese opposition, the U.S. will move to invoke a provision of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers to re-impose all U.N. sanctions against Iran. The Trump administration pulled out of the deal in 2018.</p><p>Pompeo spoke at a virtual open meeting of the council on implementation of resolution 2231, which was adopted in 2015 to endorse the Iran nuclear deal. The arms embargo is included in the measure. </p><p>Zarif told the council later that the U.S. violated all provisions of the deal by its withdrawal and insisted that the arms embargo be lifted completely on its Oct. 18 expiration date. “Any attempt to change or amend the timetable” for lifting the embargo is tantamount to undermining the entire resolution, he said.</p><p>Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Moscow opposes "blessing” the U.S. maximum pressure policy through the arms embargo resolution. He called it a “maximum suffocation” policy aimed at regime change or creating “a situation where Iran literally wouldn’t be able to breathe,” adding in an illusion to the death of George Floyd by a white policeman in Minnesota: “This is like putting a knee on one’s neck.”</p><p>“It is obvious that the ultimate goal is to antagonize Iran and push it to radical retaliation, which will become an invitation for further sanctions,” Nebenzia said.</p><p>China’s U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun also opposed extending the arms embargo saying having quit the nuclear agreement the U.S. is no longer a participant and “has no right to trigger” the so-called snap-back provision in the resolution to re-impose U.N. sanctions.</p><p>Pompeo noted that Iran’s President Hasan Rouhani recently declared that “Iran will give a crushing response if the arms embargo on Tehran is extended.” He expressed hope that Zarif would later say who Iran intended to “crush" and how. </p><p>Zarif didn’t, but the foreign minister told the council: “The international community in general — and the U.N. Security Council in particular — are facing an important decision: Do we maintain respect for the rule of law, or do we return to the law of the jungle by surrendering to the whims of an outlaw bully?”</p><p>Pompeo seized on findings in a report this month by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres who said the United Nations has determined that Iran was the source for several items in two arms shipments seized by the U.S., and for debris left by attacks on Saudi Arabia’s oil installations and an international airport.</p><p>The report also said some of the items seized by the U.S. in November 2019 and February 2020 “were identical or similar” to those found after cruise missiles and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia in 2019. </p><p>Pompeo also blamed Iran for other actions, including an attack on U.S.-led coalition forces in Iraq in January using its advanced missiles, and supplying Shiite militia forces who have launched dozens of rocket attacks since last year against U.S. and coalition forces fighting Islamic State extremists.</p><p>If the arms embargo is lifted, he said “Iran will be free to purchase Russian-made fighter jets that can strike up to a 3,000-kilometer radius – putting cities like Riyadh, New Delhi, Rome, and Warsaw in Iranian crosshairs.” </p><p>Pompeo said Iran would also be free to upgrade and expand its submarine fleet and to purchase advanced technologies for its Middle East proxies including Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria, and Yemen’s Houthi Shiite rebels. </p><p>And it will be free “to become a rogue weapons dealer, supplying arms to fuel conflicts from Venezuela, to Syria, to the far reaches of Afghanistan,” he said.</p><p>Zarif refuted many of the findings of the report and accused the U.S. of “maliciously” raising matters extraneous to the nuclear agreement, “such as Iran’s defensive capabilities and regional policies,” which are also “parroted by a handful of its allies and clients.”</p><p>He said these issues were deliberately left out of the deal because both sides disagreed on certain issues. He pointed to the U.S. unwillingness to address “our grave concerns over its unfathomable level of arms sales and build-up in our neighborhood” and its interventions in the Middle East.</p><p>Pompeo said he detailed only a fraction of “the overwhelming evidence” against Iran and told the council that the U.S. call to maintain the arms embargo is backed by Middle East countries from Israel to the Gulf “who are most exposed to Iran’s predations.”</p><p>The Trump administration has won only tepid support from allies for the U.S. draft resolution to maintain the arms embargo, and European countries are expected to present a counter-proposal that would extend at least parts of the embargo for six months. It is not clear if the U.S., Russia or China would support such a proposal.</p><p>Zarif said the U.S. has no rights under resolution 2231 “nor can its enablers try to save its face via so-called middle-ground formulas.”</p><p>The council meeting took place a day after Iran issued an arrest warrant and asked Interpol for help in detaining President Donald Trump and dozens of others it believes carried out the U.S. drone strike that killed a top Iranian general, Qassem Soleimani, in Baghdad earlier this year. Trump faces no danger of arrest and Interpol later said it would not consider Iran’s request. </p><p>However, the charges underscore the heightened tensions between Iran and the U.S. since Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the nuclear deal with world powers in 2018 and re-imposed crippling U.S. sanctions on Tehran.</p><p>The five other powers that signed the nuclear deal — Russia, China, the United Kingdom, France and Germany — remain committed to it, saying the agreement is key to continuing inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency and preventing Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons.</p><p>European Union Ambassador Olof Skoog told the council the nuclear deal “has removed the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran from the regional security equation” in a verifiable way and the international community shouldn't assume it will again be able to address Iran’s nuclear program so comprehensively.</p><p>___</p><p>Lee reported from Washington.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>St. Louis mayor blasted for revealing identity of protesters</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/national/2020/06/30/st-louis-mayor-blasted-for-revealing-identity-of-protesters/</link><description>The mayor of St. Louis is being pressed to resign after she publicly revealed the names and addresses of anti-police protesters.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/news/national/2020/06/30/st-louis-mayor-blasted-for-revealing-identity-of-protesters/</guid><dc:creator>Jim Salter, Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 21:28:25 +0000</pubDate><media:group><media:content height="3588" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/deRhRiWGrx6jTR_zKe8fcMOBrRQ=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/WYORCGADLVD2PASLHBVXZFN5SY.jpg" width="5384"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[FILE - In this Nov. 17, 2019, file photo, St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson sits during an NCAA college basketball game between Saint Louis and Seton Hall in St. Louis.

She was elected on a pledge to curb violence in her city.</p><p>Amid that backdrop, it’s not surprising that calls to “defund” police don’t sit well with her.</p><p>But Krewson went a step further: She publicly revealed the names and addresses of anti-police protesters, a decision that drew extra criticism in the tense weeks following George Floyd’s death at the hands of a white Minneapolis officer who pressed his knee to Floyd’s neck. More than 50,000 people have signed a petition calling for her resignation.</p><p>Releasing the names and addresses was dangerous “because you never know what someone else will do with that information,” Aldermanic President Lewis Reed said Tuesday.</p><p>Alderwoman Megan Green said Krewson's action was “designed to intimidate and to quell dissent and to stop a movement that is happening not just locally" but across the country.</p><p>Jeff and Lyda Krewson and their two small children were returning home from shopping in 1995 when two carjackers approached with guns. Jeff Krewson was fatally shot in the neck as he tried to back the car away. Lyda Krewson and her children, ages 2 and 5, were not hurt.</p><p>St. Louis was violent then, as it is now. The city of 300,000 people that is about evenly split between Black and white residents typically has one of the nation's highest murder rates, and 2020 is shaping up to be another brutal year.</p><p>It’s also a region with a long history of racial strife that boiled over in 2014 when a white officer fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was Black, in nearby Ferguson. Officer Darren Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing and eventually resigned, and the shooting drew attention to the uneasy relationship between St. Louis-area police and Black residents.</p><p>Krewson, 67, who is white, defeated three high-profile Black candidates in the March 2017 Democratic primary, helped by an endorsement from the police union. She won easily in the April general election.</p><p>Protests again erupted months later after a white former police officer, Jason Stockley, was acquitted in the death of a Black suspect. During a downtown demonstration in September 2017, more than 120 people were arrested, some violently, including bystanders and journalists. On another night, protesters broke windows and threw paint on Krewson's home.</p><p>Floyd’s death reignited tensions in St. Louis. Speaking live on Facebook on Friday, Krewson said she had met with protesters who presented her with written suggestions for the city budget, including proposals to cut funding for police. She read the names and addresses of some of the demonstrators.</p><p>It was not clear why she did so. She later removed the video and apologized, saying on Twitter that she “didn’t intend to harm anyone or cause distress.” But the response was angry and swift.</p><p>Protesters marched to Krewson’s home Sunday night and painted the word “RESIGN” on the street.

And, in prepared remarks, Biden accused Trump of “waving the white flag” as coronavirus cases spike nationwide and the death toll surpasses 125,000.</p><p>The one-two punch reflects the core of Biden’s candidacy, which he built on the argument that Trump is morally and temperamentally unfit to lead the nation. He sought again Tuesday to draw sharp contrasts with his own experience and style as a former vice president and longtime senator.</p><p>Biden stopped short of saying Trump had violated his oath of office or should face any consequences from Congress based on any inaction on potential Russian bounties. But he called it “an absolute dereliction of duty if any of this is even remotely true,” and, in that case, he added, “the public should, unrelated to my running, conclude that this man is unfit to be president of the United States of America.”</p><p>
<a href="https://apnews.com/fcf3ec359401c7575f5402b4da9b00a3">The Associated Press has reported</a> that at least one of Trump’s daily intelligence briefings included evidence of Russian bounties. Trump has insisted that he was never briefed on such details because they weren’t credible.</p><p>Biden said Tuesday he has not had a classified briefing on the material or on Trump’s handling of it, but he said he may request one soon. Major-party nominees receive daily intelligence briefings, but Biden is not yet the official nominee, and he noted that he no longer has access to the same classified information that he could regularly review during his two terms as vice president.</p><p>Biden throughout the campaign has hammered Trump for “cozying up” to Russian President Vladimir Putin and other autocrats, and Biden warned as recently as Monday that Putin’s long-term goal is to destabilize NATO and Western alliances that have been in place since World War II.</p><p>Biden said Trump should have called his military and national security team together to reconcile any intelligence discrepancies on the Russian bounty reports. “He should have, at a minimum, picked up the phone and said, ’Vladimir, old buddy, if any of this is true … you’ve got a big problem,” Biden said.</p><p>The 77-year-old Biden also used Trump’s explanations – that he didn’t know about any such intelligence reports – to turn the tables on the president’s frequent mockery of Biden’s mental acuity. Biden said Trump, 74, “doesn’t seem to be cognitively aware,” and he embraced the possibility of general election debates. “I can hardly wait to compare my cognitive capability to the cognitive capability of the man I’m running against,” Biden said. </p><p>On the coronavirus, Biden lambasted Trump for not harnessing the power of the federal government. </p><p>“He called himself a wartime president. ... What happened? Now it’s almost July, and it seems like our wartime president has surrendered, waved the white flag and left the battlefield.”</p><p>Biden said he’d implement a national system of testing for the virus and tracing the exposure path of those who are diagnosed. He said that’s necessary to restore the confidence that businesses, workers and consumers need to jump-start the economy. Biden added that widespread use of masks and social distancing practices must become normal protocol for the “foreseeable future,” and he warned that COVID-19 “will likely worsen” during the coming flu season.</p><p>“We can’t continue half recovering, half getting worse,” Biden said. “We can’t continue half with a plan and half just hoping for the best. We can’t defeat this virus with a piecemeal approach.”</p><p>He cast Trump as wanting to be a national “cheerleader” without backing it up with hard truths and action. “We need a president, Mr. President,” Biden said. </p><p>Trump's reelection campaign countered that the president has been at the forefront of the nation's coronavirus response.</p><p>While “Joe Biden spent the last 5 months trying to come up with a plan, the President has been leading one that slowed the spread, made us the world leader in testing, and reopened our economy,” Ali Pardo, deputy communications director, said in a statement.</p><p>The former vice president said that one of his first actions as president, if he wins, would be to ask Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal government’s leading infectious-disease expert, to continue serving. Trump has often contradicted Fauci’s guidelines on the coronavirus. <a href="https://apnews.com/8e2b3b7ca3bb2475b9ae901dad4e09ee">Fauci warned at a Senate hearing Tuesday</a> that he wouldn’t be surprised if the daily count of new cases reaches 100,000 without further intervention.</p><p>Biden delivered his remarks just miles from his residence, where he’s spent most of his campaign time since early March. That's when governors and mayors around the country first began issuing stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines to prevent the pandemic’s spread. </p><p>For the first time, Biden weighed in Tuesday on the widespread push to take down monuments and honors for long-dead Americans who held white supremacist views. He drew a contrast between Confederate Civil War figures and those who helped found the nation, even if they owned slaves.</p><p>“The idea of comparing whether or not George Washington owned slaves or Thomas Jefferson owned slaves and somebody who was in rebellion, committing treason, trying to take down a union to keep slavery -- I think there’s a distinction there,” Biden said.</p><p>He said statues of Washington and Jefferson should be protected, despite the fact “they may have things in their past that are now, and then, distasteful.”</p><p>___</p><p>Barrow reported from Atlanta.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SpaceX launches Air Force's newest GPS satellite</title><link>https://www.local10.com/tech/2020/06/30/spacex-launches-air-forces-newest-gps-satellite/</link><description>SpaceX has launched the military's newest, most accurate GPS satellite.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/tech/2020/06/30/spacex-launches-air-forces-newest-gps-satellite/</guid><dc:creator>Marcia Dunn, Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 21:12:03 +0000</pubDate><media:group><media:content height="2745" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/p72KZd7itXzIdoiV5tOf6A7Vnhs=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/YPYJP24QUZH6NO2U4JONM2D25U.jpg" width="4888"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[A Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket, with a global positioning satellite for the U.S. Space Force, lifts off from launch complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Fla., Tuesday, June 30, 2020.

Invited actors include Ana De Armas (“Knives Out”), Brian Tyree Henry (“If Beale Street Could Talk”), Florence Pugh (“Little Women”), Lakeith Stanfield (“Sorry to Bother You”), Beanie Feldstein (“Booksmart”) and Constance Wu (“Crazy Rich Asians”). Directors like Lulu Wang (“The Farewell”), Ari Aster (“Midsommar”), Terence Davies (“The House of Mirth”) and Matthew Vaughn (“Layer Cake”) are also on the list. </p><p>A handful of actors from this year’s best picture winner “Parasite,” including Jang Hye-Jin, Jo Yeo-Jeong, Park So-Dam and Lee Jung-Eun, were also invited to join.

The vehicle will be key to the company's sales as it faces a highly competitive European car market amid severe headwinds from the coronavirus.</p><p>Citroen brand head Vincent Cobee said that the new hatchback represents “the core of the European market, which is the family car."</p><p>“We're talking about the largest segment of the European market," Cobee told The Associated Press. He said the vehicle's hybrid posture combining SUV elements means the C4 “is an interesting offer in this huge segment" and "quite significant in terms of brand direction and ambition." </p><p>Electrics have thus far carried higher purchase prices that outweighed lower running costs. but Cobee said that was changing. While prices won’t be disclosed until later, he said that “the cost of ownership of this battery car will be completely comparable to the cost of ownership of the combustion engine” once all factors are considered. “Today, if your approach is cost of ownership, the gap is nearly closed,” he said.</p><p>Cobee called the presentation format “phygital,” combining some physical presence by the presenters and a larger online audience. </p><p>The new C4 shakes up the design of its predecessor by adding elements more familiar from SUVs such as a higher seat position, more ground clearance and prominent wheel arches. In addition to diesel and gasoline versions it will come in an electric-only variant with a 50 kilowatt-hour battery that offers range of up to 350 kilometers (217 miles) and can charge to 80% in 30 minutes - if a fast-charging station is available.</p><p>On top of the virus outbreak the auto industry faces headwinds from European Union regulatory requirements to lower average emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas blamed by scientists for climate change. Carmakers are aiming to meet the new limits with a combination of battery vehicles, hybrid cars that use both electric motors and internal combustion engines, and more-efficient gasoline and diesel models. </p><p>Sales prospects for all carmakers are uncertain as demand recovers from lockdowns that closed dealerships and unsettled consumers. Citroen's sales fell 86.4% in April during the period of the most severe restrictions on activity, to 9,500 vehicles from 69,900 in the same month last year. </p><p>Automakers had been moving more marketing events online even before the virus outbreak to save the costs of auto show attendance and to get exclusive focus on their product. </p><p>Geneva auto show organizers said that exhibitors told them they would rather wait until 2022 to resume the show. This year’s edition was canceled in March due to the outbreak. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump's two Russias confound coherent US policy</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/politics/2020/06/30/trumps-two-russias-confound-coherent-us-policy/</link><description>When it comes to Russia, the Trump administration just can’t seem to make up its mind.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/news/politics/2020/06/30/trumps-two-russias-confound-coherent-us-policy/</guid><dc:creator>Matthew Lee, Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 20:01:53 +0000</pubDate><media:group><media:content height="3190" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/P0l9oE-WbFKrnd4u05oHh-bdgMA=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/OOKYDDVAYJFHZH2AYEQDAEO64Y.jpg" width="4730"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[FILE - In this July 16, 2018, file photo Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, and U.S. President Donald Trump give a joint news conference at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki, Finland.

As Trump has repeatedly and openly cozied up to Putin, his administration has imposed harsh and meaningful sanctions and penalties on Russia.</p><p>The dizzying, often contradictory, paths followed by Trump on the one hand and his hawkish but constantly changing cast of national security aides on the other have created confusion in Congress and among allies and enemies alike. To an observer, Russia is at once a mortal enemy and a misunderstood friend in U.S. eyes.</p><p>Even before Trump took office questions about Russia abounded. Now, nearing the end of his first term with a difficult reelection ahead, those questions have resurfaced with a vengeance. Intelligence suggesting Russia was encouraging attacks on U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan by putting bounties on their heads has thrust the matter into the heart of the 2020 campaign.</p><p>The White House says the intelligence wasn't confirmed or brought to Trump's attention, but his vast chorus of critics are skeptical and maintain the president should have been aware.</p><p>The reports have alarmed even pro-Trump Republicans who see Russia as a hostile global foe meddling with nefarious intent in Afghanistan, the Middle East, Ukraine and Georgia, a waning former superpower trying to regain its Soviet-era influence by subverting democracy in Europe and the United States with disinformation and election interference. </p><p>Trump’s overtures to Putin have unsettled longstanding U.S. allies in Europe, including Britain, France and Germany, which have expressed concern about the U.S. commitment to the NATO alliance, which was forged to counter the Soviet threat, and robust democracy on the continent. </p><p>But Trump has defended his perspective on Russia, viewing it as a misunderstood potential friend, a valued World War II ally led by a wily, benevolent authoritarian who actually may share American values, like the importance of patriotism, family and religion.</p><p>Trump's approach to Russia was at center stage in the impeachment proceedings, when U.S. officials testified that the president demanded political favors from Ukraine in return for military assistance it needed to combat Russian aggression. But the issue ended up as a largely partisan exercise, with House Democrats voting to impeach Trump and Senate Republicans voting to acquit.</p><p>Within the Trump administration, the national security establishment appears torn between pursuing an arguably tough approach to Russia and pleasing the president. Insiders who have raised concern about Trump's approach to Russia — including at least one of his national security advisers, defense secretaries and secretaries of state, but especially lower-level officials who spoke out during impeachment — have nearly all been ousted from their positions.</p><p>Suspicions about Trump and Russia go back to his 2016 campaign. His appeal to Moscow to dig up his opponent’s emails, his plaintive suggestions that Russia and the United States should be friends and a series of contacts between his advisers and Russians raised questions of impropriety that led to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. The investigation ultimately did not allege that anyone associated with the campaign illegally conspired with Russia.</p><p>Mueller, along with the U.S. intelligence community, did find that Russia interfered with the election, to sow chaos and also help Trump's campaign. But Trump has cast doubt on those findings, most memorably in a 2018 appearance on stage with Putin in Helsinki. </p><p>Yet despite Trump's rhetoric, his administration has plowed ahead with some of the most significant actions against Russia by any recent administration. </p><p>Dozens of Russian diplomats have been expelled, diplomatic missions closed, arms control treaties the Russians sought to preserve have been abandoned, weapons have been sold to Ukraine despite the impeachment allegations and the administration is engaged in a furious battle to prevent Russia from constructing a new gas pipeline that U.S. lawmakers from both parties believe will increase Europe’s already unhealthy dependence on Russian energy.</p><p>At the same time, Trump has compounded the uncertainty by calling for the withdrawal or redeployment of U.S. troops from Germany, angrily deriding NATO allies for not meeting alliance defense spending commitments, and now apparently ignoring dire intelligence warnings that Russia was paying or wanted to pay elements of the Taliban to kill American forces in Afghanistan.</p><p>On top of that, even after the intelligence reports on the Afghanistan bounties circulated, he's expressed interest in inviting Putin back into the G-7 group of nations over the objections of the other members.</p><p>White House officials and die-hard Trump supporters have shrugged off the obvious inconsistencies, but they have been unable to staunch the swell of criticism and pointed demands for explanations as Russia, which has vexed American leaders for decades, delights in its ability to create chaos.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>UK allows e-scooter rentals to aid transport in pandemic</title><link>https://www.local10.com/business/2020/06/30/uk-allows-e-scooter-rentals-to-aid-transport-in-pandemic/</link><description>Britain is giving the green light for trials of electric scooter rental programs, as authorities look for ways to help people get moving while maintaining distance and easing pressure on public transit.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/business/2020/06/30/uk-allows-e-scooter-rentals-to-aid-transport-in-pandemic/</guid><dc:creator>Kelvin Chan, Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 19:58:33 +0000</pubDate><media:content height="2848" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/V_xI0n4D9_46EAwA8VZycUFR45I=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/UR6SVIJG2BDW7PULPCSOSPNPUI.jpg" width="4960"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[FILE - In this Friday, Sept. 13, 2019 file photo, electric rental scooters lie on a sidewalk in Berlin, Germany.

They were initially scheduled for next year and have now been fast-tracked because of the coronavirus. The government wants them to start by the end of August and run for 12 months. Riders will need to have a valid driver's license and be at least 16. The scooters won't be able to go faster than 15.5 mph (25 kph). </p><p>Legalization only applies to rentals. Under the new rules it remains illegal for e-scooters owned by individuals to be ridden on public roads in Britain, but that hasn't stopped an increasing number of people using them. </p><p>Rental e-scooters have already become a common sight in European cities like Paris and Brussels, often strewn across sidewalks. </p><p>Swedish startup VOI, which operates in 10 European countries and plans to expand to Britain, said it expects huge demand for short journeys. </p><p>“We’ve seen an explosion of demand in all our cities across Europe” because of the pandemic, said U.K. General Manager Richard Corbett. </p><p>The number of VOI’s rides per day has doubled compared with before the pandemic, Corbett said.</p><p>“I think a lot of that is driven by people who are scared to use public transport and they see this as a viable alternative.” </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cinemark to reopen movie theaters, pizza continues to sell</title><link>https://www.local10.com/business/2020/06/30/cinemark-to-reopen-movie-theaters-pizza-continues-to-sell/</link><description>Cinemark Holdings will reopen some of its U.S. movie theaters on July 24, with additional theaters reopening in subsequent weeks.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/business/2020/06/30/cinemark-to-reopen-movie-theaters-pizza-continues-to-sell/</guid><dc:creator>Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 19:26:47 +0000</pubDate><media:group><media:content height="4075" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/gWPhDb1drEEIJSq4R72OyMts558=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/F3ZHA37IKFBJ7HA6KGXYXSCFS4.jpg" width="6113"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Passengers arrive at the Barcelona airport, Spain, Tuesday, June 30, 2020.

Trump and his allies tout his successful appointment of two conservatives to the Supreme Court, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, as reason not only to reelect the president but also to elect Republicans to the Senate as well.</p><p>While Republicans routinely run on promises of appointing conservative justices to the Supreme Court and federal bench, the issue has drawn less focus for Democrats.

He was 94.</p><p>Mandel died Monday of a cardiac ailment at his home in Ojai, California, according to Lauren Iossa, executive vice president and chief marketing officer of ASCAP. Mandel served on the ASCAP board of directors from 1989-2011. </p><p>“Giant. Genius. Gentleman. There are many ways to describe the legendary composer Johnny Mandel. His incredible music spanned decades, mediums, oceans and firmly established him in the American Songbook canon," ASCAP Chairman and President Paul Williams said in tribute.</p><p>Mandel was among the last of the great songwriters to emerge in the pre-rock ‘n’ roll era, his career dating back to the 1940s, and he enjoyed a long and diverse career. He played trombone and trumpet with such big band and jazz artists as Jimmy Dorsey and Count Basie and spent two years in the 1950s arranging music for Sid Caesar’s landmark TV sketch program “Your Show of Shows.” He collaborated on songs with Johnny Mercer, Paul Williams and the husband and wife team Alan and Marilyn Bergman. Artists recording his material ranged from Marvin Gaye to Stan Getz to Barbra Streisand.</p><p>He even worked on the soundtrack for “Caddyshack.”</p><p>“I don’t have a method or a style, and I never wanted one,” Mandel said during a 2010 interview with The National Endowment for the Arts, which the following year gave him a Jazz Masters award for lifetime achievement. “Some guys really try to have a style. I just work with what’s there and try to do the best with what’s there.”</p><p>As an arranger, Mandel worked with some of the greatest singers of his time. When Sinatra launched his own label, Reprise Records, in 1960 he chose Mandel to arrange his first album there, the exuberant “Ring-a-Ding-Ding!” In the early 1990s, Cole called upon him for her Grammy-winning smash “Unforgettable,” which featured duets with tapes of her late father (and Sinatra’s friend), Nat King Cole. </p><p>In recent years he contributed arrangements for Streisand’s “Love Is the Answer” and Tony Bennett’s “The Art of Romance.” Decades earlier, Bennett sang a memorable cover of “The Shadow of Your Smile,” the theme from the Richard Burton-Elizabeth Taylor movie “The Sandpiper.” The Mandel-Paul Francis Webster ballad won a Grammy in 1966 for song of the year, topping the Beatles’ “Yesterday” among others, and received an Oscar for best original song.</p><p>Mandel also helped write soundtracks for “Being There,” “I Want to Live!” and “The Americanization of Emily,” and songs originating from his film work included the Oscar-nominated “A Time for Love” and the Golden Globe-nominated “Molly and Lawless John.”</p><p>His most widely heard composition was likely “Suicide is Painless,” the droll theme from Robert Altman’s Korean War satire “M(asterisk)A(asterisk)S(asterisk)H,” and later for the hit TV show that starred Alan Alda. In a 2008 interview with the blog JazzWax, Mandel explained that Altman had asked him to come up with a song and made two requests: Call it “Suicide is Painless” and make it as stupid as possible.</p><p>“I said to myself, ‘Well I can do stupid,’” Mandel recalled, adding that Altman brought in extra help for the lyrics.</p><p>“Bob was going to take a shot at the lyrics. But he came back two days later and said, ‘I’m sorry but there’s just too much stuff in this 45-year-old brain. I can’t write anything nearly as stupid as what we need.’ Bob said, ‘All is not lost. I’ve got a 15-year-old kid who’s a total idiot.’ So Michael Altman, at age 15, wrote the lyrics, and then I wrote the music to them.”</p><p>Mandel was born in New York City in 1925, and credited some of his passion for music to his mother, Hannah, an opera singer. Aware from an early age he had perfect pitch, he studied at the Manhattan School of Music and the Juilliard School. By the 1940s, he was writing arrangements and performing with such stars as drummer Buddy Rich and such unlikely musicians as saxophonist Alan Greenspan, the future chairman of the Federal Reserve. </p><p>Mandel was primarily a melodist and would seek out lyricists for his songs. For “The Shadow of Your Smile,” he went first to Mercer, with whom he had written “Emily” from “The Americanization of Emily.” But Mercer turned him down, worrying that the song sounded too much like “New Orleans,” by Mercer’s friend Hoagy Carmichael. “Shadow of Your Smile” became a standard, and Mercer would long regret his decision.</p><p>“Years later, he and Hoagy were drinking at a party or something and Hoagy said, “There’s something I meant to ask you for a long time.

Those who refuse to do so, or tested positive, or do not have the test results available, will be forced into a two-week quarantine. During that time, they have to undergo a molecular test and share the results if they want to be released from quarantine, said Puerto Rico Health Secretary Lorenzo González.</p><p>“If you don’t want to be tested, stay home. Don’t come here and complicate our situation,” he said.</p><p>Most molecular tests involve a nose or throat swab and are used to diagnose an active infection. Puerto Rico’s government will not accept any other test, including antibody ones that require a finger stick or blood drawn.</p><p>The island of 3.2 million people is emerging from a lockdown that began in mid-March. The government has reported at least 153 deaths, along with more than 1,690 confirmed cases and more than 5,770 probable ones.</p><p>González acknowledged that the government will not track every single violator ordered into quarantine. Instead, the monitoring via a system known as “Sara Alert” will be random and target those who do not respond to tracking efforts, including phone calls and personal visits. Passengers who do not respond to text messages requesting health updates will be fined.</p><p>Gov. Wanda Vázquez said her administration will recruit 350 people to help with tracking and monitoring efforts.</p><p>“We cannot let our guard down, especially with people who live elsewhere and are infected,” she said.</p><p>The new rules come amid an alarming resurgence of cases in the U.S. mainland, with states like Texas, Florida and California backtracking on reopenings. Meanwhile, worldwide, officials report 500,000 confirmed deaths and 10 million confirmed cases.</p><p>Several weeks ago, Vázquez asked the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to temporarily ban commercial flights from cities in the U.S. mainland that are considered coronavirus hotspots. The FAA did not respond to that request.</p><p>Puerto Rico expects to receive up to 9,000 passengers a day in upcoming months, compared with the roughly 4,500 daily current arrivals, said Carla Campos, executive director of Puerto Rico’s Tourism Company.</p><p>Vázquez's administration will require that all passengers fill a form prior to arriving in Puerto Rico with required information including where the test was taken. Vázquez also stressed that everyone has to wear a mask if they’re outside or going into a business.</p><p>Puerto Rico’s main international airport will continue to be the only one accepting all commercial flights, with no date yet on when other airports, including a smaller international one in the island’s northwest region, will reopen. Currently, passengers can voluntarily undergo a test at the Luis Muñoz Marín airport. More than 280,000 people have been tested, with more than 660 positive results, said Gen. José Burgos, commissioner of the island’s Emergency Management Bureau.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Using 'face doubles,' new HBO doc captures LGBTQ purge</title><link>https://www.local10.com/entertainment/2020/06/29/using-face-doubles-a-new-doc-captures-an-anti-lgbtq-purge/</link><description>Anonymous sources in documentaries have often been reduced to a shadowy, voice-distorted figure, or a pixelated blur.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/entertainment/2020/06/29/using-face-doubles-a-new-doc-captures-an-anti-lgbtq-purge/</guid><dc:creator>Jake Coyle, Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 18:29:55 +0000</pubDate><media:group><media:content height="2160" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/V6mYybV4HJdCLHJKfw9lcDhM-uU=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/RENGVTCIAJGRPERYHVLZBWJD44.jpg" width="3840"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[This undated photo provided by HBO Documentary Films shows a scene from "Welcome to Chechnya," about an underground pipeline created to rescue LGBTQ Chechens from the Russian republic where the government has waged a crackdown of gays.

<a href="https://www.hbo.com/documentaries/welcome-to-chechnya">“Welcome to Chechnya,”</a> directed by David France, is about an underground pipeline created to rescue LGBTQ Chechens from the Russian republic where the government has for several years <a href="https://apnews.com/63a15d4aa08247c5b9115f7b5db91eb2">waged a crackdown on gays</a>. In the predominantly Muslim region in southern Russia ruled by strongman Ramzan Kadyrov, LGBTQ Chechens have been detained, tortured and killed.</p><p>France, the filmmaker behind “How to Survive a Plague” and “The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson,” worked in secrecy with the Russian LGBT Network, a group formed to help save gay Chechens and find them asylum abroad. But France had a dilemma. He couldn’t reveal the identities, or the faces, of his main characters. Their lives depended on staying anonymous.</p><p>Yet France still wanted to faithfully show the trials they were enduring. This was a tragedy that needed a face. That meant none of the old methods of cloaking anonymous sources would work.</p><p>“They were dehumanizing,” France said in an interview. “I believe one of the reasons we haven’t been hearing about this ongoing crime against humanity in the south of Russia is because we haven’t been able to hear from the people and see the people who have suffered this unspeakable torture. When the only testimony of a crime of this magnitude comes from people who are behind a curtain, it lacks the empathy of the public that this story truly deserves.”</p><p>France didn’t know how he would resolve the issue, but he promised those he shot that he would somehow disguise them. After searching and testing a range of approaches, France settled on a novel one: In “Welcome to Chechnya,” the faces of all the LGBTQ Chechens have been replaced using artificial intelligence. It’s a little like the documentary answer to “The Irishman” or a more altruistic version of a <a href="https://apnews.com/21fa207a1254401197fd1e0d7ecd14cb/I-never-said-that!-High-tech-deception-of-'deepfake'-videos">“deepfake.”</a></p><p>The faces seen in “Welcome to Chechnya” belong, in fact, to 22 volunteers whose faces were superimposed on the people in the film. Most of them are LGBTQ activists in New York. The “face doubles” were shot on a blue screen stage and converted into algorithms that, with machine learning, could digitally mask the subjects of the film. Different voices were substituted, too.</p><p>“Nobody had ever really attempted this before,” said France. “And most people said it was impossible. It turned out it was pretty close to impossible but not impossible.”</p><p>The technology was developed by software architect Ryan Laney. And its implementation was decided through a study organized by Dartmouth College professor Thalia Wheatley, an expert in brain sciences. She showed 109 students different visual effects options of “Welcome to Chechnya” to determine which one conveyed empathy the best and avoided an “uncanny valley” effect. (Another less successful option was using filters to render the film’s individuals cartoon-like caricatures.)</p><p>Still, adding the face doubles throughout the film was a grueling, months-long process that only concluded a week before the premiere of “Welcome to Chechnya” at the Sundance Film Festival in January. “The Irishman,” by comparison, altered its actors’ faces in highly planned scenes with carefully orchestrated camera movement. France’s documentary was full of erratic movements of both camera and people.</p><p>Every step of the way, France and his editors worked on encryption drives, and never let their original footage with real faces touch the internet or even a computer that had previously been connected to the internet. They edited in what France calls a windowless bunker in Los Angeles.</p><p>“It added a lot of time to our work,” said France, “But it reminded us everyday what the stakes were and what it meant to be the people whose lives were shared with us and entrusted us in sharing their lives with a wider audience.”</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP">http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mortar shells hit after Somalia celebrates reopened stadium</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/world/2020/06/30/mortar-shells-hit-after-somalia-celebrates-reopened-stadium/</link><description>At least three mortar blasts have sent sports fans in Somalia ducking for cover, hours after the Mogadishu Stadium reopened following years of instability.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/news/world/2020/06/30/mortar-shells-hit-after-somalia-celebrates-reopened-stadium/</guid><dc:creator>Abdi Guled, Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 18:29:30 +0000</pubDate><media:group><media:content height="3299" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/kIJ_jJXvkjJPc8PEPpWAemazo0w=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/2NU2ZYGFVFGDVA5PBDGZU4Q7BI.jpg" width="4948"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Somalia's President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, center, prepares to cut the ribbon for the reopening of the stadium in Mogadishu, Somalia Tuesday, June 30, 2020.

It’s not clear if that kind of broad-stroke testing would reduce spread of the coronavirus, CDC concluded. Instead, it urged colleges to focus on containing outbreaks and exposures as students return.</p><p>Lawmakers also pressed for what Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the committee’s top Democrat, called a national vaccine plan — to be sure the race for the COVID-19 vaccine ends with shots that really are safe, truly protect and are available to all Americans who want, one.</p><p>“We can’t take for granted this process will be free of political influence,” Murray said. She cited how President Donald Trump promoted a malaria drug as a COVID-19 treatment that ultimately was found to be risky and ineffective.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration released guidelines Tuesday saying any vaccine that wins approval will have to be at 50% more effective than a dummy shot in the final, required testing. That’s less effective than many of today’s vaccines but independent experts say that would be a good start against the virus.</p><p>FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said vaccine makers also must test their shots in diverse populations, including minorities, the elderly, pregnant women and those with chronic health problems.</p><p>“We will not cut corners in our decision-making,” Hahn told senators.</p><p>About 15 vaccine candidates are in various stages of human testing worldwide but the largest studies -- including 30,000 people each -- needed to prove if a shot really protects are set to begin in July. First up is expected to be a vaccine created by the NIH and Moderna Inc., followed closely by an Oxford University candidate.</p><p>At the same time, the Trump administration’s “Operation Warp Speed” aims to stockpile hundreds of millions of doses by year’s end, so they could rapidly start vaccinations if and when one is proven to work.</p><p>Redfield said the CDC already is planning how to prioritize who is first in line for the scarce first doses and how they’ll be distributed.</p><p>But a vaccine is at the very least many months away. For now, the committee’s leading Republican stressed wearing a mask -- and said Trump, who notoriously shuns them, needs to start because politics is getting in the way of protecting the American people.</p><p>“The stakes are too high for the political debate about pro-Trump, anti-Trump masks to continue,” said Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who chaired Tuesday’s hearing. </p><p>Alexander said he had to self-quarantine after a staff member tested positive for the virus but that he personally was protected because his staffer was wearing a mask. </p><p>“The president has plenty of admirers. They would follow his lead,” Alexander said. “The stakes are too high” to continue that fight.</p><p>___</p><p>AP writers Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar and Matthew Perrone in Washington, Collin Binkley in Boston and Mike Stobbe in New York contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

The sides have been holding talks for several months on finalizing a map spelling out which areas of the West Bank will be annexed by Israel.</p><p>“I spoke about the question of sovereignty, which we are working on these days and we will continue to work on in the coming days,” Netanyahu said.</p><p>Netanyahu has been eager to begin annexing West Bank territory in line with President Donald Trump's Mideast plan. The plan, unveiled in January, envisions turning over some 30% of the territory under permanent Israeli control, while giving the Palestinians autonomy in the remaining land.</p><p>But the plan to redraw the Mideast map has come under fierce international criticism. The U.N. secretary-general, the European Union and key Arab countries have all said Israeli annexation would violate international law and undermine the goal of establishing a viable independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. The Palestinians, who seek all of the West Bank as part of a future state, have rejected the Trump plan.</p><p>Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war. The international community considers the territory to be occupied, and for Israel’s more than 120 settlements to be illegal.</p><p>But Trump has taken a far more conciliatory line than his Republican and Democratic predecessors. Netanyahu, a close ally of Trump, has said Israel must take advantage of what he calls a “historic opportunity,” and is eager to move forward before the November presidential election.</p><p>In an unsourced report, Israel's public broadcaster Kan published a graphic Tuesday showing what it said was proposed Israeli modifications to the initial annexation map proposed by Trump. </p><p>The map calls for turning over additional West Bank territory allocated to the Palestinians, specifically land surrounding settlements and highways that is marked in green. In return, it proposes “compensating” the Palestinians with territory, marked in yellow, the Trump proposal had allocated to Israel.</p><p>Israel’s Channel 12 TV reported that the American negotiators are asking Israel to make “a significant step” as a gesture to the Palestinians, such as handing over West Bank territory to Palestinian control comparable to that annexed. Israel currently has full control over 60% of the West Bank.

Health officials think infected people who aren't showing symptoms are largely responsible for the rising number of cases across more than half of states. </p><p>“Pooling would give us the capacity to go from a half-a-million tests per day to potentially 5 million individuals tested per day,” Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, told a recent meeting of laboratory experts.</p><p>For now, federal health regulators have not cleared any labs or test maker to use the technique. The Food and Drug Administration issued guidelines for test makers in mid-June and wants each to first show that mixing samples doesn’t reduce accuracy, one of the potential downsides.</p><p>So it's not clear when pooled testing may be available for mass screenings at schools and businesses.</p><p>The principle is simple: Instead of running each person's test individually, laboratories would combine parts of nasal swab samples from several people and test them together. A negative result would clear everyone in the batch. A positive result would require each sample to be individually retested. Pooling works best with lab-run tests, which take hours — not the much quicker individual tests used in clinics or doctor's offices. </p><p>The idea for pooling dates from World War II, when it was considered for quickly screening blood samples from U.S. draftees for syphilis. Since then it has been adopted to screen blood samples for HIV and hepatitis. And developing countries have used pooled samples to stretch testing supplies. </p><p>China reported using the approach as part of a recent campaign to test all 11 million residents of Wuhan, the city where the virus first emerged late last year.</p><p>“Americans think this is some new concept because ordinarily we don’t have this challenge of having to stretch testing capacity,” said Darius Lakdawalla, a health economist at the University of Southern California.</p><p>Lakdawalla and colleagues estimate that pooled testing could save schools and businesses between 50% and 70% on costs. Under their model, a group of 100 employees could be divided into 20 batches of five people. Assuming 5% of people carry the virus, only five pools would test positive, requiring individual testing. Ultimately, 45 tests would be needed for the pooled approach, versus 100 individual tests.</p><p>But pooling won’t always be the best option. Importantly, it won’t save time or resources when used in COVID-19 hot spots, such as an outbreak at a nursing home. That’s because the logistical and financial benefits of pooling only add up when a small number of pools test positive.</p><p>Experts generally recommend the technique when fewer than 10% of people are expected to test positive. About 7% of U.S. tests have been positive for the virus in the past week, according to an AP analysis, though rates vary widely from place to place. For example, pooling would not be cost-effective in Arizona, where a surge has pushed positive test results to over 22%. But the approach could make sense in New Jersey, with a positivity rate under 2%.</p><p>Nebraska’s state health laboratory used batch testing with special permission from the governor and the FDA beginning in March. The lab’s director said they had to stop several weeks ago when their positive rate jumped to 17% with outbreaks at meat packing plants. </p><p>“We knew that pooling wasn’t working anymore when those rates started going up,” said Dr. Peter Iwen. </p><p>Reserving pooled testing for large groups with low rates of infection dovetails with the government's increasing focus on people without symptoms spreading the virus, especially younger people.</p><p> “It’s a really good tool. It can be used in any of a number of circumstances, including at the community level or even in schools,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, told a Senate hearing Tuesday.</p><p>Still, health officials may have to convince some key players to adopt the method. LabCorp, one of the nation's biggest testing chains, said in an email that it is familiar with pooled testing but currently believes “individual patient testing is the most effective and efficient way" to screen for COVID-19.</p><p>Dr. Colleen Kraft of Emory University worries that batched testing — with its multiple rounds of screening for some patients — could slow test results, a key factor for getting those infected into quarantine.</p><p>“If you are trying to do something rapid, this actually prolongs the turnaround time," Kraft said.</p><p>She and others also have concerns about accuracy, since test performance tends to drop when screening in larger groups of people where the targeted disease is less common. </p><p>“If we can’t trust the test results then there’s no point in doing the test,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, of the Johns Hopkins University’s Covid-19 Testing Insights Initiative.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Matthew Perrone on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/AP_FDAwriter">@AP_FDAwriter</a></p><p>___</p><p>AP writers Lauran Neergaard in Washington, Nicky Forster in New York and Christina A.

She asked the H-E-B employee if he had any recommendations on how she could get the things that were missing.</p><p>“I really can’t come into the store myself,” she told the employee. “I don’t want to bring anything in there or take it to my nursing home.”</p><p>The worker told Bow another shipment was coming in the morning and that he would give her a call then to let her know if he’d be able to find her missing items.</p><p>“He called at 7 a.m. the next day and had some items,” Bow said. “He said, ‘I will set it aside for you -- let curbside know.'”</p><p>Bow said what happened when she got there to pick up the rest of her items brings tears to her eyes when she tells the story.</p><p>When she pulled up, she tried to explain the situation to the person who was helping her (it was his first day), but there was some confusion regarding her order.</p><p>But when another employee came out, Bow told her the whole story from the day before and that morning.</p><p>“’Oh wait, I know exactly who you are,’” Bow said the employee said to her.</p><p>“She goes back inside and comes out with my bag. She says, ‘We just want to thank you for all that you’re doing.’”</p><p>The girl handed her a thank-you card, along with the groceries.</p><figure><img alt="Kyle H-E-B employees sign thank you card for nursing home employee." height="960" src="https://www.local10.com/resizer/cozcuRQ9qc2vCHdBf3jjahyPNec=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/CYWBXR4WRFFFXJDMYGHY6LUU4E.jpg" width="720"/><figcaption>Kyle H-E-B employees sign thank you card for nursing home employee.</figcaption></figure><p>“They had all signed it. I couldn’t believe it,” Bow said. “You’re going to thank me when you’re here working in the rain?”</p><p>Not only did store workers sign the thank-you card, but they told her not to worry about the rest of her groceries -- they’d been paid for.</p><p>Though she’s admittedly not someone who makes frequent posts to social media, and said she hesitated even this time, Bow said she really felt like she needed to, in some way, recognize the H-E-B employees working every day.</p><p>“They are seeing tons more people than I have, so their risk of coming down with something is greater than even mine,” she said.</p><p>Bow said the nursing home where she works has become a really sad place. The residents aren’t allowed visitors or to leave their rooms. Even volunteers who would come to walk around with juice carts or serve early-morning coffee have disappeared.</p><p>“I’ve been bringing my iPad to let them call their loved ones,” Bow said. “The only positive part is that some of them don’t remember they didn’t see their loved ones yesterday. Many others feel safe where they are, but they’re worried about their family."</p><p>So although she said she’s emotionally drained and her heart breaks for her residents, the gesture that was made by the H-E-B employees meant more to her than she could possibly convey.</p><p>As Bow attempted to tag H-E-B in her Facebook post, she said she noticed so many people leaving nasty comments or bad reviews about not getting items they wanted, or other situations within the store.</p><p>“I tried to tag them and saw all these negative reviews, and I’m thinking, ‘They can’t help it! They have no control over people who are trying to hoard the food. They are working 110% over capacity.’"</p><p>So along with wanting to remind everyone to be kind when they’re out and about dealing with people, she expressed the utmost gratitude for this not-so-small gesture.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content height="960" type="image/jpeg" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/cozcuRQ9qc2vCHdBf3jjahyPNec=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/CYWBXR4WRFFFXJDMYGHY6LUU4E.jpg" width="720"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[Kyle H-E-B employees sign thank you card for nursing home employee.]]></media:description></media:content></item><item><title>Belarus denies main president challenger spot on ballot</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/world/2020/06/30/belarus-denies-main-president-challenger-spot-on-ballot/</link><description>The central elections commission in Belarus has rejected a top challenger's bid to run against authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko in this summer's election.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/news/world/2020/06/30/belarus-denies-main-president-challenger-spot-on-ballot/</guid><dc:creator>Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 17:36:03 +0000</pubDate><media:group><media:content height="3071" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/_uA3YyMcNIvpoNCpr7Dp4s2uoSg=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/Q5FW5TC3BJCEFCHCFKQGM542CQ.jpg" width="4274"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[In this picture taken on Wednesday, May 26, 2020, Valery Tsepkalo, a potential candidate in the upcoming presidential election, smiles in Minsk, Belarus.

It said based on the auditor’s report, the Vatican’s criminal prosecutors authorized the seizure Tuesday of documentation and computers from the “Fabbrica di San Pietro,” the offices that manage the pope's basilica.</p><p>The Vatican provided no details about what the auditor flagged or the specific problems the extraordinary commissioner has been tasked with fixing.

For more information on the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium, visit the <a href="https://news.umiamihealth.org/en/focusing-on-you-cancer-research-at-sylvester-comprehensive-cancer-center/?utm_source=wplg&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=cancer-research-at-sylvester-comprehensive-cancer-center" target="_blank">UHealth health news blog</a>.</p><p><b>COVID-19 CANCER CONSORTIUM</b></p><p>When the novel coronavirus first began spreading across the U.S., it was unclear how it might affect people with cancer. In response, a small group of oncologists began using Twitter to discuss the need for a comprehensive patient database, thus launching the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium.</p><p>“We started with five founding institutions and we now have more than a hundred institutions across the United States and around the world,” says Dr. Gilberto Lopes, a medical oncologist at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center and one of the founding members of the group.</p><p>The COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium has enrolled more than 2,500 patients, yielding data that is providing doctors with a better understanding of the relationship between cancer and COVID-19. Initial findings were recently released at an international meeting of oncologists. In general, patients with cancer were found to have a higher chance of developing complications if infected with the novel coronavirus.</p><p>With safety top of mind, Sylvester has implemented new protocols to protect patients as they continue their treatments. Among other measures, physicians at Sylvester use personal protective equipment, no visitors are allowed, and patients are screened for COVID-19 symptoms, and are tested when necessary.</p><p>When new mom Tracey Hecht, 36, discovered blood in her breast milk while under quarantine for the pandemic, she initially did not want to go to the doctor. Her family insisted and she was diagnosed with breast cancer in early May. Tracey is being treated with chemotherapy at Sylvester at Plantation, under the care of Dr. Carmen Calfa. With a baby at home, Tracey had additional concerns about exposure to COVID-19.</p><p>“Sylvester has eased my mind about going into the clinic,” says Tracey. “Each time that I go in there I have my temperature taken three times. I have questions asked at least two times. All of the bases are covered. Anyone you encounter that is a provider is in head-to-toe PPE. All of the patients are in masks and kept at a distance. It gives me a lot of confidence that I can go in there and be as healthy as possible while getting my treatment.”</p><p>The importance of continuing treatment for patients with cancer is one of the most significant findings that has emerged from the COVID-19 Cancer Consortium, says Dr. Lopes. The research also showed that people who smoke and those patients who are older are at higher risks of complications.</p><p>“Our mission at Sylvester Comprehensive Center is not just to treat patients with cancer but to generate the treatments that would bring better results,” says Dr. Lopes. “We have done that through the COVID-19 pandemic. We have been one of the founding leading centers of the COVID-19 in cancer consortiums and this is how we generate information that has maximum impact for our patients.”</p><p><b>FOCUSING ON YOU</b></p><p><i>Focusing on You: Innovations in Modern Medicine</i> is a series of healthcare-related stories airing regularly on WPLG Local 10.

He was 72.</p><p>The Ronald Meadows Funeral Parlor in Hinton confirmed it. A funeral home official who declined to give his name said Tuesday that Whittaker died of natural causes, but he refused to say when or where, and he said a service would be private. </p><p>Whittaker became an instant celebrity at 55 when he claimed what was then the largest U.S. lottery jackpot won by a single ticket. He opted for the lump-sum payout of $113.4 million after taxes, and flew off to New York with his family in a private jet to appear on network TV morning shows.</p><p>But he quickly fell victim to scandals, lawsuits and personal setbacks as he endured constant requests for money, leaving him unable to trust others. Several times, he was quoted as saying he wished he had torn up the ticket. </p><p>His wife left him. A friend of his drug-addicted granddaughter was found dead at his home in 2004. Three months later, his 17-year-old granddaughter was gone, too. </p><p>His daughter, Ginger Whittaker Bragg, died in 2009 at age 42 after struggling for years with cancer.</p><p>And in 2016, he lost a Virginia home to a fire.</p><p>He struggled with drinking and gambling. His home and car were repeatedly burglarized. At a strip club, thieves broke into his Lincoln Navigator and stole a briefcase stuffed with $245,000 and three $100,000 cashiers’ checks. </p><p>That time, at least, he caught a break — the briefcase was later found, with the money still inside.</p><p>Whittaker was charged twice with driving while under the influence and sued repeatedly, once by three female casino employees who accused him of assault.</p><p>In a 2007 interview with The Associated Press, Whittaker knew his legacy was already written.</p><p>“I’m only going to be remembered as the lunatic who won the lottery,” Whittaker said. “I’m not proud of that. I wanted to be remembered as someone who helped a lot of people.”</p><p>At that point, Whittaker said he still had plenty of money. How much remained at his death, and who might benefit from his estate, was not immediately clear on Tuesday.</p><p>Known for wearing cowboy hats and western-style clothing, Whittaker was a self-made millionaire long before he won the lottery, having built construction businesses worth $17 million. </p><p>A regular Powerball player, Whittaker, who then lived in Scott Depot, already had concrete plans to share his prize with churches and his family when he claimed his winnings. </p><p>“I’ve had to work for everything in my life. This is the first thing that’s ever been given to me,” Whittaker said then. </p><p>A foundation started in Whittaker’s name spent $23 million building two churches in the years after his jackpot win, and his family donated food, clothing and college scholarships to local students. </p><p>Whittaker also put his granddaughter, Brandi Bragg, on his payroll. But his plans to give his inheritance to her were vanquished just before Christmas in 2004, when her body was found in a junked van, hidden by a boyfriend who panicked when he found her dead. An autopsy didn't pinpoint a cause.</p><p>“She was going to inherit everything,” Whittaker said.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Supreme Court lifts ban on state aid to religious schooling</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/politics/2020/06/30/supreme-court-lifts-ban-on-state-aid-to-religious-schooling/</link><description>The Supreme Court has made it easier for religious schools to obtain public funds, upholding a Montana scholarship program that allows state tax credits for private schooling.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/news/politics/2020/06/30/supreme-court-lifts-ban-on-state-aid-to-religious-schooling/</guid><dc:creator>Mark Sherman, Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 17:10:31 +0000</pubDate><media:group><media:content height="4000" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/njSWe8Takb61rQvVv3DLqsonlrk=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/UY2MGZURUFGD3A7YMYQDKBT2HM.jpg" width="6000"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[The Supreme Court is seen in Washington, early Monday, June 15, 2020.

The state court had ruled that the tax credit violated the Montana constitution’s ban on state aid to religious schools.</p><p>Chief Justice John Roberts wrote <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-1195_g314.pdf">the opinion</a> that said the state ruling itself ran afoul of the religious freedom, embodied in the U.S. Constitution, of <a href="https://apnews.com/0444c7240eb34bb59d9911789692191f">parents who want the scholarships</a> to help pay for their children's private education. “A state need not subsidize private education. But once a state decides to do so, it cannot disqualify some private schools solely because they are religious,” Roberts wrote.</p><p>In a dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor described the ruling as “perverse.”</p><p>"Without any need or power to do so, the Court appears to require a State to reinstate a tax-credit program that the Constitution did not demand in the first place,” she said.</p><p>Parents whose children attend religious schools sued to preserve the program. The high court decision upholds families' rights “to exercise our religion as we see fit,” said Kendra Espinoza, the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit whose two daughters attend the Stillwater Christian School in Kalispell, Montana, near Glacier National Park. </p><p>Roughly three-dozen states have similar no-aid provisions in their constitutions. Courts in some states have relied on those provisions to strike down religious-school funding.</p><p>Two states with existing private education programs, Maine and Vermont, could see quick efforts to force them to allow religious schools to participate. </p><p>Attorney General William Barr praised the ruling as “an important victory for religious liberty and religious equality in the United States.” The Trump administration supported the parents' Supreme Court appeal.</p><p>Advocates for allowing state money to be used in private schooling said the court recognized in its decision that parents should not be penalized for sending their children to schools that are a better fit than the public schools.</p><p>“This opinion will pave the way for more states to pass school choice programs that allow parents to choose a school that best meets their child’s individual needs, regardless of whether those schools are religious or nonreligious,” said Erica Smith, a senior attorney with the Institute for Justice, which represented the parents in their court fight.</p><p>But the president of the Montana Federation of Public Employees, which counts more than 12,000 teachers and other school workers as union members, called the decision “a slap in the face" to its members and the communities they serve.</p><p>“Today’s decision violates Montana’s commitment to public education, our children, and our constitution. Extremist special interests are manipulating our tax code to rob Montana children of quality education while padding the pockets of those who run exclusive, discriminatory private schools,” union president Amanda Curtis said.</p><p>In a separate concurring opinion, Justice Samuel Alito pointed to evidence of anti-Catholic bigotry that he said motivated the original adoption of the Montana provision and others like it in the 1800s, although Montana’s constitution was redone in 1972 with the provision intact. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whose two daughters attend Catholic schools, made a similar point during arguments in January when he talked about the “grotesque religious bigotry” against Catholics that underlay the amendment.</p><p>The decision was the latest in a line of decisions from the Supreme Court, which now includes Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, that have favored religion-based discrimination claims. In 2014, the justices allowed family-held, for-profit businesses with religious objections to get out from under a requirement to pay for contraceptives for women covered under their health insurance plans. In 2017, the court ruled for a Missouri church that had been excluded from state grants to put softer surfaces in playgrounds.</p><p>The high court also is weighing a Trump administration policy that would make it easier for employers to claim a religious or moral exemption and avoid paying for contraceptives for women covered by their health plans. Still another case would shield religious institutions from more employment discrimination claims.</p><p>The Supreme Court also has upheld some school voucher programs and state courts have ratified others. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Miami's 3 favorite spots to find cheap Middle Eastern fare</title><link>https://www.local10.com/features/2020/06/30/miamis-3-favorite-spots-to-find-cheap-middle-eastern-fare/</link><description>Here's a rundown of top affordable Middle Eastern restaurants in the city, with ratings, photos and more.

The list is to be updated every 14 days, with new countries being added and some even dropping off depending on whether they are keeping the disease under control.</p><p>Still, many people both inside and outside Europe remain wary of travel in the coronavirus era, given the unpredictability of the pandemic and the possibility of second waves of infection that could affect flights and hotel bookings. Tens of thousands of travelers had a frantic, chaotic scramble in March to get home as the pandemic swept across the world and borders slammed shut.</p><p>The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States has surged over the past week, and President Donald Trump also suspended the entry of all people from Europe’s ID check-free travel zone in a decree in March.</p><p>In contrast, aside from a notable recent outbreak tied to a slaughterhouse in western Germany, the virus’s spread has generally stabilized across much of continental Europe.</p><p>European Union countries hastily slapped restrictions on who could cross their borders in February as the virus spread in Italy. Then in mid-March the Europeans limited all non-essential travel to the 27 EU member states plus Liechtenstein, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.</p><p>Non-EU citizens who are already living in Europe are not included in the ban.</p><p>The EU list does not apply to travel to Britain, which left the EU in January. Britain now requires all incoming travelers — bar a few exceptions like truck drivers — to go into a self-imposed 14-day quarantine, although the measure is under review and is likely to ease in the coming weeks. The requirement also applies to U.K. citizens.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP coverage of the pandemic at <a href="https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak">https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Coronavirus cases surge: Miami-Dade increases testing, enforcement, education</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/06/30/coronavirus-testing-demand-continues-in-miami-dade-amid-surge-in-cases/</link><description>Eager to undergo a coronavirus test, hundreds of drivers waited in line for hours on Tuesday at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens and at the Miami Beach Convention Center in South Beach.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/06/30/coronavirus-testing-demand-continues-in-miami-dade-amid-surge-in-cases/</guid><dc:creator>Trent Kelly, Christina Vazquez, Andrea Torres</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 17:01:28 +0000</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eager to undergo a coronavirus test, hundreds of drivers waited in line for hours on Tuesday at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.

Racism is alive and well,” School Board Member Dr. Rosalind Osgood said. </p><p>The discussion of renaming the five Broward public schools containing the city name “Plantation” was brought up by Osgood. </p><p>Tuesday morning’s meeting was open to public comment over possible changes. </p><p>The discussion comes amid nationwide conversations surrounding race, sparked by protests against the killing of George Floyd.</p><p>“If these people are feeling hurt, if people are feeling that it’s a reminder of something that we would no longer like to remember, then I think that I would like to, as briefly as possible, tell you to please listen,” one commenter, Terry Lopez Preuss, said.  </p><p>Commenters spoke both for and against name changes.</p><p>One commenter spotlighted the city of Plantation’s history and that the name plantation comes from the Everglades Plantation Company, which drained the area where the city now stands for farmland, and that the area was not affiliated with slavery or slave plantations. </p><p>“We love our city, we like the name, and I’m here today to ask for us to take a breath (and) not make any rash decisions as far as the city of Plantation names go,” Aston Bright said. </p><p>The school names in question include Plantation High, South Plantation High, Plantation Middle, Plantation Elementary and Plantation Park Elementary. Osgood suggested the board change its school naming guidelines moving forward to exclude names with racial connotations. </p><p>Current guidelines already prohibit naming schools after cities, but the five Plantation schools were named prior to the issuance of that guideline. </p><p>Name changing potential will be discussed in a future workshop.</p><p>So far, school board members agreed that there should be a task force to discuss renaming of schools, but whether that take place at the county level or within individual school communities is still up for debate. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cadillac crashes on top of other vehicles at dealership</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/06/30/cadillac-crashes-on-top-of-other-vehicles-at-dealership/</link><description>A driver was rushed to a hospital Tuesday morning after he ran his Cadillac off the road in northwest Miami-Dade, authorities said.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/06/30/cadillac-crashes-on-top-of-other-vehicles-at-dealership/</guid><dc:creator>Madeleine Wright, Amanda Batchelor</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 16:55:18 +0000</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A driver was rushed to a hospital Tuesday morning after he ran his Cadillac off the road in northwest Miami-Dade, authorities said.</p><p>The crash was reported in the area of Northwest 27th Avenue and 98th Street in the West Little River neighborhood.</p><p>A police officer at the scene told Local 10 News reporter Madeleine Wright that the driver lost control of the car and the vehicle flew on top of other vehicles at a used car dealership.</p><figure><img alt="Driver loses control of car and crashes into used car dealership in northwest Miami-Dade." height="720" src="https://www.local10.com/resizer/iWP-coHct_8RrWL2PwfQeLW5co8=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/ZK6X5O4NKRFKDIOGYN2ZVSEOVM.jpg" width="1280"/><figcaption>Driver loses control of car and crashes into used car dealership in northwest Miami-Dade.</figcaption><small><span class="copyright">WPLG</span></small></figure><p>Surveillance video shows the white Cadillac El Dorado blowing a stop sign, bumping into a grassy median and slamming into the used car dealership around 5 a.m.</p><p>“Apparently this guy was speeding really, really bad,” the owner’s father, Hector Borroto Sr., said.</p><p>In a bizarre twist, a woman, believed to be the passenger, got out of the car and climbed a fence to escape, leaving the wounded driver behind.</p><p>Paramedics were at the scene within 10 minutes.</p><p>They took the driver to North Shore Medical Center with what are believed to be non-life threatening injuries.</p><p>“I don’t know how’s the guy.

Around 11 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, and some 9 million don’t have enough to eat. More than half of the population have no jobs.</p><p>International anti-poverty organization Oxfam said the amount pledged fell short of what is needed.</p><p>“The pledges made by donor governments are simply not enough to address the Syrian crisis with 1 million people at risk of starvation inside the country, and COVID-19 and an economic downturn hitting refugees and host communities in neighboring countries hard," said Marta Lorenzo, Oxfam's Middle East and North Africa regional director. </p><p>U.N. Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator for Syria Imran Riza, speaking from Qamishli in northern Syria, underscored the problems.</p><p>“We are on the cusp of all these multiple crises,” Riza said. “You see kids that are clearly now getting malnourished. You are seeing levels of malnutrition that we have never seen in the last nine years and this gets worse and worse if you don’t take action right now.” </p><p>German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas pledged 1.584 billion euros ($1.8 billion) on Germany’s behalf as he, too, warned that the global pandemic was exacerbating the grim realities of life in war-shattered Syria.</p><p>“Access to humanitarian assistance is even further restricted,” he said during the virtual donor conference. “And health facilities that lie in ruins cannot attend to the enormous needs. Today, we can demonstrate that the world cares, that the people of Syria are not forgotten.”</p><p>Britain’s International Development Secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, pledged 300 million pounds to support areas including education, food and fighting the coronavirus.</p><p>“We cannot and will not ignore the scale of the coronavirus threat in Syria, which has already been ravaged by almost a decade of conflict,” Trevelyan said. </p><p>EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell announced that EU institutions would donate 2.3 billion euros ($2.6 billion) for this year and next.</p><p>Perhaps wary of the state of coronavirus-ravaged national coffers, the EU and the U.N. - joint chairs of the conference - underlined that they did not set a fixed pledging target. U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Mark Lowcock said about $10 billion is needed and that raising $5.5 billion “would not be a bad outcome.”</p><p>Lenarcic said at the end of the conference that $5.5 billion of the money pledged Tuesday would be available this year and $2.2 billion for next year and beyond.</p><p>The EU has reported that in 2019 donors contributed 8.9 billion euros ($10 billion) in grants to Turkey, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. The United Nations currently requires about $3.8 billion for its Syria-related work. Speakers at Tuesday's fundraising meeting repeatedly expressed support for Syria's neighbors housing refugees.</p><p>Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab said the cost to his country of hosting more than 1 million Syrian refugees has exceeded $40 billion since the conflict began in March 2011 and he warned that the situation is getting worse amid an economic crisis.</p><p>Diab called on the U.N., the EU and friendly nations to “shield Lebanon from the negative repercussions" of sanctions, such as those imposed on Syria by the Trump administration in mid-June.</p><p>Lowcock acknowledged that holding the donor conference at a time when economies around the world have been slammed by the coronavirus was tough.</p><p>“We recognize that circumstances are a bit unusual," he said. "It’s a difficult moment in every country to find the resources necessary to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people, but it’s essential that we do go on doing that work.”</p><p>Oxfam's Lorenzo said: “It’s shocking that the international community has failed to recognize the urgency of the situation despite clear calls from Syrian civil society.” </p><p>____</p><p>Corder reported from The Hague, Netherlands.

Lam declined to comment on the national security law at a weekly meeting with reporters, saying it was inappropriate for her to do so while the Standing Committee meeting was still in progress.(AP Photo/Vincent Yu)]]></media:description><media:credit role="author">Vincent Yu</media:credit></media:content></media:group><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China on Tuesday approved a contentious national security law for Hong Kong that takes direct aim at some of the actions of anti-government protesters last year, in a move many see as Beijing’s boldest yet to erase the legal firewall between the semi-autonomous territory and the mainland’s authoritarian Communist Party system.</p><p>Details of the law remained under wraps until 11 p.m. (1500 GMT, 11:00 a.m. EDT), when it was published and took effect immediately. </p><p>The text specifies that those who destroy government facilities and utilities would be considered subversive. Damaging public transportation facilities and arson would constitute acts of terrorism. Any person taking part in secessionist activities, whether organizing or participating, will violate the law regardless of whether violence is used.</p><p>“We hope the law will serve as a deterrent to prevent people from stirring up trouble,” said Tam Yiu-Chung, Hong Kong’s sole representative on the Standing Committee “Don’t let Hong Kong be used as a tool to split the country.”</p><p>The law took effect ahead an hour before July 1, the 23rd anniversary of the territory’s passing from Britain to China. Amid protests in Hong Kong last year, demonstrators broke into the legislative building on the anniversary, spray painted slogans on the walls and heavily damaged the electronic voting system. </p><p>During months of protests, they frequently smashed subway ticket machines and electronic sensors at entry gates, and disrupted service by holding doors open so trains couldn't leave the stations. </p><p>President Xi Jinping signed a presidential order promulgating the law after its approval by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, the official Xinhua News Agency said. It was to be added to the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s constitution.</p><p>Under the law, those found guilty of inciting secessionist, subversive, terrorist activities and colluding with foreign forces could face life imprisonment if they are deemed masterminds of such activities.</p><p>The legislation also states that Hong Kong's government “shall take necessary measures to strengthen publicity, guidance, supervision and management” for schools, social groups, media, internet and other matters related to national security.</p><p>Hong Kong will establish a committee responsible for maintaining national security in the city. It will be chaired by chief executive Carrie Lam and will be accountable to and supervised by the Chinese government.</p><p>Passage of the law came amid fears in Hong Kong and abroad that it would be used to curb opposition voices in the financial hub. The U.S. has already begun moves to end special trade terms given to Hong Kong after the former British colony was returned to China in 1997.</p><p>Speaking in a video message to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, Lam said the law would “only target an extremely small minority” of lawbreakers, would not be retroactive, and that mainland legal bodies would only have jurisdiction in “rare, specified situations.”</p><p>Critics say it is the most significant erosion to date of Hong Kong’s British-style rule of law and the high degree of autonomy that Beijing promised Hong Kong would enjoy at least through 2047 under a “one country, two systems” framework. </p><p>Hong Kong pro-democracy activists Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow and Nathan Law issued statements on Facebook saying they would withdraw from their organization Demosisto, which then announced that it would disband with the loss of its top members. </p><p>Wong said “worrying about life and safety” has become a real issue and nobody will be able to predict the repercussions of the law, whether it is being extradited to China or facing long jail terms.</p><p>A group of about 30 pro-China supporters gathered at Hong Kong's Tamar Park on Tuesday, waving Chinese flags. Organizers said that the rally was to show support of the national security law, and to celebrate Hong Kong’s return to China. </p><p>Meanwhile, more than 100 protesters gathered at a luxury mall in Hong Kong’s Central business district, chanting slogans including “Free Hong Kong, Revolution Now,” with several holding a flag representing an independent Hong Kong as well as posters condemning the law.</p><p>The law’s passage “represents the greatest threat to human rights in the city’s recent history,” said Joshua Rosenzweig, head of Amnesty International’s China Team. </p><p>“The speed and secrecy with which China has pushed through this legislation intensifies the fear that Beijing has calculatingly created a weapon of repression to be used against government critics, including people who are merely expressing their views or protesting peacefully,” Rosenzweig said in a statement.</p><p>Concerns also were expressed in Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary.</p><p>“Democracy and freedom are shared universal values of Hong Kong and Taiwan,” the island’s Mainland Affairs Council said, adding that China had betrayed its promises to Hong Kong,</p><p>The self-governing island recently said it would consider providing asylum for Hong Kong opposition figures who fear arrest.</p><p>Ahead of the law’s passage, the Trump administration said it will bar defense exports to Hong Kong and will soon require licenses for the sale of items that have both civilian and military uses.</p><p>“We cannot risk these items falling into the hands of the People’s Liberation Army, whose primary purpose is to uphold the dictatorship of the (ruling Communist Party) by any means necessary,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.</p><p>British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said his government was “deeply concerned” by reports of the law’s passage, saying that would be a “grave step.” Britain has said it could offer residency and possible citizenship to about 3 million of Hong Kong’s 7.5 million people.</p><p>"This issue is purely China’s internal affairs, and no foreign country has the right to interfere," Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said.</p><p>He said China would take necessary measures to protect its national interests in response to “the wrong acts of the United States.”</p><p>Under the law, Beijing will set up a national security office in Hong Kong to collect and analyze intelligence and deal with criminal cases related to national security. </p><p>Government critics fear Beijing will use the law to pursue political opponents. Some have questioned the legal basis for the legislation, saying it undermines the Basic Law.</p><p>An earlier attempt to pass a security law in 2003 was dropped after hundreds of thousands of people marched in Hong Kong against it. </p><p>China for years had put off another such effort. Citing a new urgency after last year's protests, it announced it would bypass the Hong Kong legislature and enact the law on its own. </p><p>Chinese officials have railed against what they call foreign interference in the territory that they blame for encouraging the anti-government protests. Beijing condemned the protests as an attempt to permanently split Hong Kong from China.</p><p>Drafting of the law took place amid intense secrecy, with even top Hong Kong officials reportedly not given advance notice of its specifics. </p><p>Questions linger over the effects on Hong Kong’s free press that has come under increasing political and financial pressure, as well as the operations of nongovernmental organizations, particularly those with foreign connections. </p><p>The law’s passage comes after Hong Kong’s legislature in early June approved a contentious bill making it illegal to insult the Chinese national anthem. Pro-China figures have also been pushing for more “patriotic” education to be introduced into the curriculum in hopes that will boost their identification with Beijing.</p><p>___</p><p>Moritsugu reported from Beijing. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New arrest warrants issued in case of Mexico's missing 43</title><link>https://www.local10.com/news/world/2020/06/30/new-arrest-warrants-issued-in-case-of-mexicos-missing-43/</link><description>Nearly six years after 43 students disappeared in Mexico’s southern Guerrero state, Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero says prosecutors have obtained 46 arrest warrants for various municipal officials in the state in relation to the case.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/news/world/2020/06/30/new-arrest-warrants-issued-in-case-of-mexicos-missing-43/</guid><dc:creator>Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 16:32:34 +0000</pubDate><media:content height="3200" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/5xIJjKXe2IYGmJx1OSToU-3SDWM=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/TRXUH67TYFDZJDVHB537HRYA5U.jpg" width="4800"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[FILE - In this April 26, 2016 file photo, family members and supporters of 43 missing teachers college students carry pictures of the students as they march to demand the case not be closed and that experts' recommendations about new leads be followed, in Mexico City.

Jackie Robinson broke the barrier in April 1947, about 2 1/2 years after Landis died.</p><p>"Landis is a part of history, even though it was a dark history,” Houston Astros manager Dusty Baker said.</p><p>Fact is, few fans realize Landis’ name is plastered all over the Most Valuable Player trophies. Most people just call it the MVP.</p><p>But there it is, prominently displayed on every American League and NL MVP plaque since 1944 — Kenesaw Mountain Landis Memorial Baseball Award, in shiny, gold letters literally twice as big as those of the winner.</p><p>With a sizable imprint of Landis’ face, too.</p><p>To some MVPs, it’s time for that 75-year run to end.</p><p>“If you’re looking to expose individuals in baseball’s history who promoted racism by continuing to close baseball’s doors to men of color, Kenesaw Landis would be a candidate,” three-time NL MVP Mike Schmidt of Philadelphia said.</p><p>“Looking back to baseball in the early 1900s, this was the norm. It doesn't make it right, though,” said the Hall of Famer, who is white. “Removing his name from the MVP trophy would expose the injustice of that era. I’d gladly replace the engraving on my trophies.”</p><p>Added 1991 NL MVP Terry Pendleton of Atlanta, who is Black: “This is 2020 now and things have changed all around the world. It can change for the better.”</p><p>“Statues are coming down, people are looking at monuments and memorials,” he said. “We need to get to the bottom of things, to do what’s right. Yes, maybe it is time to change the name.”</p><p>“I’ve always thought about that, why is that still on there?” Pendleton said. “No doubt, MVP stands on its own. It doesn’t need a name.”</p><p>Many hallowed baseball trophies are graced by the names of the greats: Robinson, Hank Aaron, Roberto Clemente, Cy Young, Willie Mays, Ted Williams and more.</p><p>How Landis got etched into the list is easy to trace.</p><p>A federal judge in Chicago, Landis quickly established his powerful authority as commissioner, banning Shoeless Joe Jackson and the Black Sox for throwing the 1919 World Series.</p><p>In 1931, Landis decided members of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America would pick and present the MVP awards. Before that, the leagues had their own mishmash system.</p><p>Then during the 1944 World Series, the BBWAA voted to add Landis’ name to the plaque as “an acknowledgement of his relationship with the writers,” longtime BBWAA secretary-treasuer Jack O’Connell said.</p><p>A month later, Landis died at 78. He soon was elected to the Hall of Fame.</p><p>“Landis is who he is. He was who he was,” Thorn said. “I absolutely support the movement to remove Confederate monuments, and Landis was pretty damn near Confederate.”</p><p>Landis’ father, however, was a Union Army surgeon wounded in the Civil War at the battle of Kennesaw Mountain in Georgia, which became the inspiration for the commissioner’s unique name. Born two years later in Ohio — with a slight tweak on the spelling of the mountain — Landis spent time in Indiana and rose to prominence in Chicago.</p><p>His precise role in racial issues has been debated for decades.</p><p>Landis broke up exhibitions between Black and white All-Star teams. He invited a group of Black newspaper publishers to address owners in what became a cordial but totally fruitless presentation.</p><p>Toward the end of his tenure, he told owners they were free to sign Black players. But there is no evidence he pushed for baseball integration, either, as the status quo of segregation remained.</p><p>“If you have the Jackie Robinson Award and the Kenesaw Mountain Landis Award, you are at diametrically opposed poles,” Thorn said. “And it does represent a conundrum.”</p><p>O’Connell said no MVP had voiced a complaint to him about Landis since taking his post in 1994. He said Landis’ name on the plaque wasn’t pledged or part of the BBWAA constitution.</p><p>Any BBWAA member could raise an objection to Landis’ presence. Normally, that would be discussed at the organization’s next gathering, currently scheduled for December at the winter meetings in Dallas. The coronavirus pandemic has put most everything-baseball related in peril — a 60-game season is set to begin in late July, and MVPs are usually announced in November.</p><p>O’Connell said if someone raised the issue now, it could be brought up to the board and opened to discussion and a vote. To pull Landis’ name “would be a simple matter of redesigning the plaque,” he said.</p><p>To Larkin, that would remove the tarnish from the trophy.</p><p>Larkin recalled that shortly after he was voted MVP, he got a call from two-time NL MVP Joe Morgan. The star Black second baseman of the Big Red Machine talked about Landis’ legacy and “he said it never sat well with him, having that name on there,” Larkin recalled.</p><p>Larkin agrees.</p><p>“His name should not be represented on a plaque or award of honor, especially at this day and time,” he said. “If his name was taken off, I would not be opposed to it at all.”</p><p>___</p><p>More AP MLB: <a href="https://apnews.com/MLB">https://apnews.com/MLB</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/AP_Sports">https://twitter.com/AP_Sports</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EU bans Pakistan airline from flying to Europe for 6 months</title><link>https://www.local10.com/business/2020/06/30/eu-bans-pakistan-airline-from-flying-to-europe-for-6-months/</link><description>The European Union’s aviation safety agency says Pakistan’s national airline will not be allowed to fly into Europe for at least six months.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/business/2020/06/30/eu-bans-pakistan-airline-from-flying-to-europe-for-6-months/</guid><dc:creator>Kathy Gannon And Adil Jawad, Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 16:06:48 +0000</pubDate><media:group><media:content height="3840" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/QPxnglG1bkZny2n3_Rw0RNkU1tM=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/RTCJVY4ZB5GMDB6JFIG6FEXKZY.jpg" width="5760"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[FILE - In this May 22, 2020 file photo, volunteers look for survivors of a Pakistan International Airlines plane that crashed in a residential area of Karachi, Pakistan.

But the airline had hoped to resume its flights to Oslo, Copenhagen, Paris, Barcelona and Milan within the next two months. </p><p>“It is hurting us really bad,” he said of the pilots scandal. </p><p>An inquiry into the May 22 Airbus A320 crash that killed 97 people at the southern port city of Karachi resulted in the stunning revelation that 260 of 860 pilots in Pakistan had cheated on their pilots exams, but were still given licences by the Civil Aviation Authority. </p><p>The government has since fired five officials of the regulatory agency and criminal charges are being considered.</p><p>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency “is concerned about the validity of the Pakistani pilot licenses and that Pakistan, as the State of operator, is currently not capable to certify and oversee its operators and aircraft in accordance with applicable international standards,” the organization said in its letter announcing the ban. </p><p>PIA has grounded 150 of its pilots for cheating. </p><p>But Hafeez told The Associated Press in a phone interview Tuesday that PIA had alerted the Civil Aviation Authority, the Pakistani regulatory body that issues pilots licences, of its concerns over some of the licenses. In 2019, PIA grounded 17 pilots over concerns about their licences after one of its aircraft skidded off the runway in northern Pakistan.</p><p>“The saddest part for PIA is that we had alerted the regulatory agency and the government,” Hafeez said. </p><p>He said the national airline will have a difficult time regaining its reputation and said that more than a decade ago PIA was considered one of the better airlines.</p><p>Aviation experts fear the ban by the European Union could also affect PIA flights to the United Kingdom and Canada because its aircraft will not be able to fly over Europe forcing longer routes.</p><p>“We have really hit rock bottom I am so sad to say,” said Hafeez.</p><p>The inquiry into the May 22 crash of PIA flight 8303 in Karachi blamed pilot error saying the pilot came in to land too low, ignoring warnings from the air traffic control tower, insisting he could manage. </p><p>The plane hit the runway and took off again but the pilot's engines were damaged. The inquiry also chastised the air traffic controller for not telling the pilot that the engines were damaged.</p><p>After the aborted landing, the aircraft was in the air for 17 minutes before crashing into a crowded neighborhood on the edge of Jinnah International Airport when both engines gave out. Two passengers survived and a 13-year old child on the ground was killed.</p><p>According to the cockpit voice recorder found later among the plane's debris, the pilots had been discussing the coronavirus throughout the flight, which had apparently affected their families.</p><p>Pakistan's aviation minister Khan last week told reporters that out of the 262 pilots who had cheated on their licences, 141 worked for PIA, which employs 450 pilots. That's more than a third of the workforce. The remaining pilots worked for private airlines. </p><p>_____</p><p>Jawad reported from Karachi, Pakistan.

But she won't have to wait too much longer to get back on the field.</p><p>Hayward is one of the 56 elite players signed to suit up when Athletes Unlimited launches the first of its professional women's sports leagues in late August. The six-week season near Chicago is part of an innovative model made for the moment. </p><p>“It's really about the best players in the world, getting together being able to showcase their abilities, work with people they don't necessarily always work with," said the 28-year-old Hayward, an outfielder. “I think as a fan, it's going to be super fun to see some former adversaries getting to team up together. It's great camaraderie. It's high energy. The stakes are high. Every game matters.”</p><p>All 30 games will be broadcast live, with 23 on ESPN and seven on the CBS Sports Network, and will be available in Canada and Latin America as well as the United States. Fans who tune in will see an impressive list of participants that includes top professionals and Olympic medalists such as Cat Osterman. </p><p>The game will look the same at least between the lines. But outside them? Things take a different turn.</p><p>Athletes Unlimited gives players a big say in decisions the league makes, whether it's the uniform colors or TV deals. There are no team owners or general managers, and investors are limiting their returns. Players get to share in the profits, in addition to at least $10,000 guaranteed, plus bonus money.</p><p>“They’re amazing athletes," said Jon Patricof, co-founder and CEO of Athletes Unlimited. “They have huge fan bases at the college level and that there’s really untapped opportunity. At the same time, we thought that if you’re going to launch a league of any sort, whether it's a men's or women's sport, you really have to innovate and think differently about where fandom is heading. And out of that came our model.”</p><p>There will be no travel, with all games in suburban Rosemont. And forget about crowning a team champion. Instead, the title will go to the individual with the most points based on a fantasy-type system. A single, for example will be 10 points. A double will bring in 20 and a victory 50. Players can also lose points. </p><p>Team rosters will change each week, too: At the end of the week, the top four players by points become captains and draft teams.</p><p>Broadcasts will show standings in real time, and players and umpires will wear microphones during the game.</p><p>“A lot of what we’re trying to do is bring in onscreen graphics, miking up of players,” Patricof said. “(There are) great enhancements that are going to elevate the broadcast to a really strong level.”</p><p>A businessman and former president of Major League Soccer's New York City FC, Patricof and fellow founder Jonathan Soros started developing Athletes Unlimited about a year ago. They envisioned a network of sports leagues that followed a sort of fantasy-based model focused on athletes rather than teams in a short and intense season. They plan to launch <a href="https://apnews.com/72179c8582ba78b0f94137a7bd10ecf7">women's volleyball in February</a> and have their sights set on other sports.</p><p>A big point of emphasis for Athletes Unlimited is building the players’ brand. They’ve been getting help from a star-laden advisory board that includes Kevin Durant, Abby Wambach and Jessica Mendoza. </p><p>Don't expect to see fans in the stands once the season opens Aug. 30. The pandemic shutdown began before tickets went on sale and the seats will remain empty. </p><p>Players will be tested frequently for the virus. Some will stay at a hotel in a Rosemont with others in corporate housing, though it's not clear if they will be in an NBA-style bubble or be allowed to go out on their own. .</p><p>Hayward is simply looking forward to playing again after having her Olympic hopes delayed.</p><p>“This is just an amazing opportunity to help me prepare and be even better when the time comes next year,” she said. “Although it's not ideal, I'm really looking forward to playing against some of these people I've been competing with all my life.”</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Supreme Court: Booking.com can trademark its name</title><link>https://www.local10.com/business/2020/06/30/supreme-court-bookingcom-can-trademark-its-name/</link><description>The Supreme Court says travel website Booking.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.local10.com/business/2020/06/30/supreme-court-bookingcom-can-trademark-its-name/</guid><dc:creator>Associated Press</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 15:45:09 +0000</pubDate><media:content height="3398" type="application/octet-stream" url="https://www.local10.com/resizer/M0668kjJV9cm1vWEbE6nojEGkXE=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/GW2YTCDWQNDNNEKYE67K5KU2LQ.jpg" width="5097"><media:description type="html"><![CDATA[The Supreme Court is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington, Monday, June 29, 2020.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services says a budget crisis could force the agency to furlough nearly three-quarters of its workforce, severely curtailing operations as tens of thousands of people wait to become citizens.</p><p>That could have potential political consequences, especially in states such as Michigan and Florida where the number of newly naturalized Americans already exceeds the narrow margin of victory for President Donald Trump in 2016.</p><p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if you have several hundred thousand people who are not in a position to vote in this election but would have been if business had been progressing normally at USCIS,” said Randy Capps of the Migration Policy Institute. “That’s been everyone’s concern.” </p><p>The citizenship agency has not detailed publicly how it will operate if it doesn’t get $1.2 billion in emergency funding from Congress before Aug. 3. It said in a written response to questions that “all USCIS operations will be impacted by a furlough" that covers more than 13,000 workers.</p><p>USCIS derives nearly all its $4.8 billion budget from fees it charges to people who apply to live or work in the country. Revenue was already in decline under Trump, whose administration has imposed a number of immigration restrictions. The agency says COVID-19 caused it to drop by half. </p><p>“The effects of the coronavirus pandemic are long reaching and pervasive, leaving few unscathed in its wake,” Acting Director Joseph Edlow said. </p><p>In written responses to questions, the agency says it would pay back the money it receives from Congress with a 10% surcharge on fees. </p><p>While the agency cites <a href="https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak">the pandemic</a> for its budget woes, immigration experts and a USCIS employee union say other factors include administration policies of devoting more resources to vetting applications and searching for fraud.</p><p>The administration has also halted a number of programs — including a recent freeze on H-1B visas for skilled workers — that provide an important source of revenue for USCIS. </p><p>“The agency has really moved away from its mission and become more of an enforcement agency that carries out the agenda of the Trump administration,” said Diego Iñiguez-Lopez, policy and campaigns manager for the National Partnership for New Americans, an immigrant advocacy organization.</p><p>USCIS typically swears in 15,000 new citizens per week. The agency said there were about 110,000 people waiting to take the oath when they shut down in-person operations in March because of the virus. It said it expects to work through the backlog by the end of July, thanks in part to ceremonies like the one held at the federal building in Detroit or similar ones outside a minor league baseball stadium in Des Moines, Iowa, and a community recreation center near San Diego.</p><p>Some in Congress have pushed to allow virtual swearing-in ceremonies, but the agency has refused.</p><p>Behind those waiting for the ceremony are a long line of some 700,000 people who have submitted applications for naturalization, facing an average time to process that has risen to 10 months from six months in the last year of the Obama administration. </p><p>That backlog has a number of causes, including a surge in interest due to the election of a president who has made <a href="https://apnews.com/16f0a84c7f21492785c3eca15f998103">restricting immigration</a> a centerpiece of his administration and the increased scrutiny of applications, said Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute.</p><p>Acting Deputy Department of Homeland Security Secretary <a href="https://apnews.com/0dd1369219a74fc19114c5784c0fb205">Ken Cuccinelli</a> presided over a naturalization ceremony Monday in Washington for 20 people, including an Afghan interpreter credited with saving five U.S. soldiers. “Welcome to you and your country from a grateful nation," he said later on Twitter.</p><p>Others who are sworn in are as varied as the country. Rosenberger, whose father brought her to the U.S. in 1968 so he could work for an electronics manufacturer, put off applying for citizenship for years in part because she liked having a U.K. passport. Then, when she did attempt it, her paperwork was lost. She re-applied in November. “I thought, the way this country is going I better get my citizenship now.” </p><p>Others are more recent arrivals. Mulugeta Turuneh came to the United States as a refugee from Eritrea in 2011 and settled in Iowa City, where he works as a truck driver. He took the oath Friday in Des Moines after a delay of several months because of the outbreak. </p><p>“God bless America,” Turuneh said afterward. “I’m so happy here. Everything is nice. Everything is cool.”</p><p>Iris Lapipan, who came to the U.S. from the Philippines as a child in the 1990s, was among those naturalizing at a recreation center in El Cajon, California. She said she is looking forward to being able to travel outside the United States and participate in the election. She said she was leaning toward former Vice President Joe Biden. “I’m excited that I can vote, especially with what is going on now,” she said.</p><p>Rosenberger is leaning the other way, saying she is generally conservative and would most likely support Trump. “Now that I’m a citizen I’m very excited about voting," she said. “You have the right now, so use it.”</p><p>___</p><p>Fox reported from Washington.

But they were outvoted because <a href="https://apnews.com/13cf2569a573a3c1153c8edc84d908c1">Chief Justice John Roberts</a> concurred with the court’s four more liberal justices.</p><p>The ruling was yet another major decision in which the conservative-leaning court failed to deliver an easy victory to the right in culture war issues during an election year; <a href="https://apnews.com/8585170d8f298582cf62ea7f65f7f0c9">one ruling</a> protects gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination in employment, and the <a href="https://apnews.com/4901a69e2fb198705ab4f5370b28810a">other rejected Trump's effort</a> to end protections for young immigrants. </p><p>Now, anti-abortion leaders say there’s an urgent need to reelect Trump so he can appoint more justices like Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. Abortion rights activists, with equal fervor, say it’s crucial to defeat Trump and end Republican control of the Senate, where the GOP majority has confirmed scores of conservative judges during Trump’s term.</p><p>
<a href="https://apnews.com/6d10cb3de220233dcda0c6ff7ecc60af">The Louisiana law</a> “was an obvious challenge to our reproductive freedom, and it points to the urgent need to vote for pro-choice candidates from the top of the ballot all the way down,” said Heidi Sieck of #VOTEPROCHOICE, an online advocacy group. “Do this in primaries, do this in runoffs, do this in special elections and do this in the general in November.”</p><p>James Bopp Jr., general counsel for National Right to Life, made a similar appeal, from an opposite vantage point. </p><p>“This decision demonstrates how difficult it is to drain the D.C. swamp and how important it is that President Trump gets reelected so that he may be able to appoint more pro-life justices,” Bopp said.</p><p>The Rev. Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life and a member of the Trump campaign’s Catholic voter outreach project, noted that two of the liberal justices — Ruth Bader Ginsberg and Stephen Breyer — are the oldest members of the court. </p><p>“Nobody can predict the future, but who’s going to name their replacements when the time comes? That is a question that motivates a lot of voters,” Pavone said. </p><p>Anti-abortion activists swiftly made clear that Monday’s ruling would not dissuade them from continuing to push tough abortion restrictions through state legislatures. </p><p>In recent years, several states have enacted near-total bans on abortion only to have them blocked by the courts. However, Texas Right to Life urged lawmakers there to press ahead with a proposed three-pronged measure that would start with a ban on late-term abortions and proceed to a total ban.</p><p>Monday's ruling "highlights the need for pro-life states to pass laws that directly protect pre-born children in new and dynamic ways rather than get distracted on regulating the corrupt abortion industry,” a Texas Right to Life statement said.</p><p>Mike Gonidakis, the president of Ohio Right to Life, questioned the wisdom of pushing now for sweeping bans. He noted that an Ohio bill sharply restricting late-term abortions had taken effect, while the courts blocked a measure passed last year that would ban most abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy.</p><p>“We have to be methodical, strategic, and take an incremental approach,” he said. “A lot of people want to go from 0 to 60 — you usually end up with nothing.”</p><p>The president of a national anti-abortion group, Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List, said she and her allies would encourage states to continue pressing forward with proposed restrictions that stopped short of near-total bans.</p><p>“These measures are extremely popular in some battleground states,” she said. “Prioritizing them is part of our electoral strategy.”</p><p>Abortion rights advocate Nancy Northup, the CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, acknowledged that Monday’s ruling “will not stop those hell-bent on banning abortion.”</p><p>“We will continue to fight state by state, law by law to protect our constitutional right to abortion,” she said. “But we shouldn’t have to keep playing whack-a-mole.”</p><p>She urged Congress to pass a bill called The Women’s Health Protection Act, which seeks to bolster women’s ability to access abortion even in states that pass laws seeking to restrict that access. The measure was introduced in May 2019 and has strong Democratic support — but no chance of passage for now due to Republican opposition.</p><p>From the other side of the debate, there also are dreams of a congressional solution.</p><p>Michael New, an abortion opponent who teaches social research at Catholic University of America, said some legal experts in the anti-abortion community believe Congress could find ways to restrict or ban abortion while circumventing the courts — for example by establishing constitutional legal protections for unborn children. </p><p>But any such measures are nonstarters for now, given that Democrats in Congress would overwhelmingly oppose them. </p><p>Whatever the strategy, New said, it would be important for the anti-abortion movement to be unified. He recalled that internal debates decades ago over how to draft a human life amendment to the Constitution did a great deal of damage to the anti-abortion cause.</p><p>Johnnie Moore, an evangelical adviser to the Trump administration, said Monday's court ruling would intensify interest in the election among religious conservatives who are a key part of Trump’s base.</p><p>“Conservatives know they are on the one-yard-line,” Moore tweeted. “Enthusiasm is already unprecedented, evangelical turnout will be too.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Elana Schor contributed to this report.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
