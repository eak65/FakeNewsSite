Tyson said an additional 80 Noel employees tested positive for COVID-19 in separate tests that were performed by their health care providers or the state’s Department of Health and Senior Services.</p><p class="">The announcement confirms suspicions that the large spike in McDonald County’s reported COVID-19 numbers starting this past weekend was the result of large-scale testing at the plant, the Springfield News-Leader reports.</p><p class="">___</p><p class="">BRASILIA, Brazil -- The Brazilian government announced on Saturday an agreement with Oxford University and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to produce a promising coronavirus vaccine that is undergoing tests.</p><p class="">Brazilian Health Ministry authorities said in a press conference that the country will pay $127 million and receive material to produce 30.4 million doses in two batches in December and January, which would allow it to quickly start inoculation efforts if the vaccine is certified to be safe and effective.</p><p class="">The total deal is for 100 million vaccines for a country of about 210 million residents. It will be produced by local vaccine maker Fiocruz.</p><p class="">British researchers started testing the experimental shot in May aiming to immunize more than 10,000 people, including older people and children.

The figures come as officials move to reclose beaches and discourage bar gatherings.</p><p class="">Experts say the true figure is undoubtedly higher. This is both because of incomplete testing and because it is becoming clearer to scientists that a significant number of people become infected with the virus but do not feel sick or show symptoms.</p><p class="">The state’s Department of Health said 24 more people have died with COVID-19, raising the death toll to 3,390. </p><p class="">Hospitalizations for COVID-19 also are ticking upward statewide.

Vucic met face to face with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but it was not clear whether Vulin did so as well.</p><p class="">Maja Gojkovic, the speaker of Serbia’s parliament, also tested positive, according to the state Tanjug news agency on Saturday.</p><p class="">Serbia has seen a spike in coronavirus cases since lifting strict lockdown measures in May, allowing large gatherings without obligatory social distancing or masks.</p><p class="">Vucic has announced he will reintroduce the tough measures if the spike continues.

Restrictions were eased in May, causing a spike in coronavirus infections and deaths.</p><p class="">Pakistan has confirmed 198,883 virus cases, including 4,035 deaths.</p><p class="">___</p><p class="">CAIRO — Egypt has lifted many of the restrictions put in place to fight the coronavirus pandemic, reopening cafes, clubs, gyms and theaters after more than three months of closure. Authorities also allowed the reopening of mosques and churches.</p><p class="">The government has been eager to resuscitate the Egyptian economy, which was hit hard by the virus outbreak.</p><p class="">In Cairo, a sprawling and bustling metropolis of some 20 million people, coffee shops reopened Saturday to receive in-house customers for the first time since mid-March.
