He also told the crowd that more testing leads to finding more cases of people who test positive.</p><p class="">Trump said that “so I said to my people slow the testing down, please.”</p><p class="">___</p><p class="">TULSA, Okla.— Teams of people wearing goggles, masks, gloves and blue gowns checked the temperatures of those entering the area where President Donald Trump is to hold a campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma..</p><p class="">The Trump campaign had pledged to conduct temperature checks as rally-goers entered and to offer face masks. Some of the people entering wore masks while their temperatures were checked with handheld thermometers that appeared not to touch the skin.</p><p class="">Oklahoma’s The health department on Saturday reported 331 new virus cases to bring the total number of confirmed cases to 10,037, with 368 deaths due to COVID-19. The actual number is likely higher because many people have not been tested.</p><p class="">Tulsa County has both the most confirmed cases and virus-related deaths in Oklahoma. Trump’s rally is taking place at a 19,000-seat indoor arena in the city of Tulsa.</p><p class="">Tulsa Health Department director Bruce Dart had said he would have liked to see the rally postponed, noting that large indoor gatherings are partially to blame for the recent spread of the virus in Tulsa and Tulsa County.</p><p class="">___</p><p class="">JOHANNESBURG — South Africa has announced nearly 5,000 new coronavirus cases for a new daily record.</p><p class="">The country has recorded a total of 92,000 confirmed cases as of Saturday, which is about 30% of all cases across the African continent.

Infections began to climb there early this month after authorities lifted movement restrictions and ended a curfew. </p><p class="">Health Minister Venko Filipce said in a TV interview that cases are increasing because residents ignored recommendations to avoid family gatherings, to wear masks and to maintain social distance.</p><p class="">In Greece, authorities announced 19 new confirmed new cases Saturday from a day earlier. The country's total number of confirmed cases now stands at 3,254, with 190 deaths.</p><p class="">Greek authorities said the median age of everyone who tested positive is 48 and 76 for those who died. </p><p class="">___</p><p class="">MADRID — Spain’s government is dropping the country’s 14-day quarantine requirement for British visitors when citizens of countries that are in Europe’s Schengen Area zone will be allowed to freely enter.</p><p class="">Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha González Laya told the BBC on Saturday: “We are doing this out of the respect for the 400,000 British citizens who have a second residence in Spain.”</p><p class="">González Laya says she hopes the British government will likewise drop the quarantine requirement for Spanish citizens traveling to the U.K..
