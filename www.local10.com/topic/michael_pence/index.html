Gina Raimondo gives an update on the coronavirus during a news conference, in Providence, R.I. Many states have yet to spend the federal funding they got to help with soaring costs related to the coronavirus crisis, making it tougher for states and cities to argue that they need hundreds of billions more from U.S. taxpayers. If I knew today that another billion dollars was coming to Rhode Island to help solve our budget deficit, Id spend the $1.25 billion now, Raimondo said about the state's portion of money. Lots of other governors are spending. Theyre taking a gamble, and Im just not ready to do that yet.
